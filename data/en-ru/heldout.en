einDkVGPUbw.mp4	0.37	2.53	Hi, my name is Caroline and this is Amanda.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	2.75	6.08	We're here at Encore Gymnastics and we are going to teach you how to do a Back Handspring.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	49.58	53.64	Right here you want to make sure that you are leaning back, if I were to move my leg she would fall.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	53.7	56.51	That's the point at which you are going to jump into this skill.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	56.94	59.7	So, head up, sit and jump, stop.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	61.46	61.89	Arms up.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	61.94	63.67	We're going to stop on your hands.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	63.8	65.19	Ready, sit, jump.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	65.82	66.18	Right there.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	66.68	73.92	This is, we call this a rainbow body or a back handspring position and then she's going to flip up and finish tall.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	75.33	76.74	We'll do that a little bit quicker.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	77.26	81.86	Arms up, sitting back, push, jump and finish.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	7.26	9.74	Before you do any activity, you want to make sure you stretch.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	82.6	83.18	Very good.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	84.69	86.22	That is how to do a back handspring.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	9.74	20.63	We're going to stretch our wrist, back and forth and ankles and the other one and also your neck.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	20.77	22.54	Up and down and back and forth.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	22.85	28.49	For this particular skill, I'm going to have you bend your knees, come forward a little and push up into a bridge.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	30.54	33.81	This will stretch all the muscles that you're going to need for this skill.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	33.81	37.2	All through your back and your legs, your stomach and your arms.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	37.24	41.5	Go ahead and come down.
einDkVGPUbw.mp4	43.79	49.26	When you do this skill, you want to start with your arms up and you're going to sit back like you're sitting in a chair.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	0.3	12.22	MATT GRAHAM: When you're changing your strings, you'll generally want to find a table or a bed or I've got an ottoman here that you can set the guitar on in front of you.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	12.25	13.32	I'm right-handed.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	96.29	103.94	And you'll see if you're going the wrong way, if you're tightening the string, the note will go higher.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	103.94	113.9	But if you're loosening it, it will get lower and lower until the strings are basically just rattling against the frets.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	113.9	120.43	So again, I'm going to get these really loose.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	131.39	132.59	And now we're ready to move on.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	13.32	15.85	I like to have the headstock pointing to my left.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	16.56	31.94	And I usually get a pillow or some soft object that's not going to scratch the back of the neck so that I can prop it up to--so that the headstock is not laying flat on the surface I'm working on.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	31.94	42.25	You can also if you have a hard case with a compartment inside, you can sometimes open the compartment of the case and prop up the neck of the guitar on the lid.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	43.06	50.0	So the first step that we're going to want to do to change these strings is to remove the old strings.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	50.06	60.12	And I'm just going to take my string-winder tool and put it on the low E string and start loosening the string.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	61.07	74.57	And generally, it's going to be that you will turn the tuning key or tuner clockwise to loosen the strings, assuming they've been put on the right way.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	74.57	81.7	Again, you can also just as easily use your fingers for this process.
eixc6o_Tl-E.mkv	81.7	95.53	And if you're new at this, you can look and just visually see the string is loosening, or you can also just pluck the string as you loosen it.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	1.27	15.4	Okay, we've almost finished the bottom of the inside of the bowl, but I see this area needs some shape definition and I want to make it more dramatic as it goes up against this white rim.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	15.62	18.07	So I'm going to get some darker paint.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	18.07	24.23	In this case denser paint.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	24.73	30.43	That is more paint on the brush because the more paint on the brush, the darker it's going to be.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	31.23	34.31	And the more water on the brush, the lighter it's going to be.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	35.76	37.11	So this is going to be a gradation.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	37.52	42.06	Now I, of course I can gradate like this, but let's do it the easy way.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	42.06	43.12	Let's turn the paper.
ej-AEb4uK2c.mkv	43.75	48.76	So, we're going to gradate this hard edge out.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	0.87	4.79	Before we put the tires back on the car, we want to take a look at tread wear.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	5.56	13.73	Now if the suspension is in line and everything is alright, we should have good tread wear from one side to the other.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	55.44	56.8	That looks in pretty good shape.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	57.3	68.46	When you look in here, you can see the brake pad, we can see there's a lot of pad left on it and that's what you want to see up against the disc.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	68.77	71.46	So, for now the brakes look good.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	71.65	73.9	We've got more life left in them.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	74.06	77.83	The tires look like they're good, we've got some more life left in them.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	78.36	79.7	Now we're ready to put the wheels back on.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	14.23	22.01	If you get something out of line your tire's sitting out on top, it's going to wear this side of your tire down more than this side.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	22.59	30.42	If it's too far in on top, it's going to wear the inside of the tire down a lot faster than it's going to wear the middle or the outside of the tire down.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	30.84	32.32	This tire looks in pretty good shape.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	32.32	41.19	They're pretty even, a little more wear here, but there's not a lot of life left on them so that's maybe not necessarily a suspension problem.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	41.73	45.5	Also the other thing we can check is the brakes.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	46.8	48.32	You can do a simple inspection.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	48.77	51.07	We look at the disc, you feel it.
ej0HzkqISSg.mp4	51.32	54.97	It feels smooth, it's wearing evenly.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	0.48	3.66	Next up we'll take a look at the E minor chord.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	4.49	8.59	First let's go back to the E major chord that we that learned a few clips back.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	55.3	61.42	Looking at this string is the C, up a whole step to D, up a whole step to E, there's our root.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	62.32	66.94	And this being the G string up a whole step to A, up a whole step to B.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	67.39	75.77	So our third is here, move it down one fret a half step and there's our E minor chord.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	9.24	10.5	That was this shape here.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	12.16	16.03	Second fret, fourth fret, fourth fret, fourth fret.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	18.57	23.18	Now in this chord we have an E, a G sharp and a B.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	23.78	30.52	Now you need to find out which note is the third, lower it by a half step and that will make the chord minor.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	30.92	34.79	So this time let's take a look at all the notes on the fret board.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	35.95	40.68	Now the high string is A, up a whole step would be B.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	42.16	50.22	The next string here is an E, up a half step is F, another half step is F sharp, up a whole step is G sharp.
ejAh5ay-g38.mkv	50.73	54.03	That's our third right there we need E, G sharp and B.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	3.74	6.12	So you see all the celebrities looking beautiful.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	6.4	7.25	They're symmetric.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	82.55	91.79	It's not something that you do every day, but if you're getting married or you need pictures taken or you want to look very glamorous, use this technique.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	92.93	96.98	Once you've got it all on, go ahead and blend it down the side.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	99.07	100.9	Again, color's important.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	101.3	109.88	You don't want it to be too dark because it would look really, really funny if you have dark shades on the side of your nose.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	111.11	112.95	Blend it out completely.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	114.3	118.37	Use your finger at the base, at the bottom like so.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	120.44	131.56	And last but not least, take a little bit of powder or use a lighter concealer and go down the base of the nose like so.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	132.55	140.81	This is really going to make that area pop and simply brush it out, blend it out, brush it out.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	140.81	143.27	We don't want to have any demarkation lines.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	145.73	153.09	So this is just a technique that you can use to help narrow your nose and give you a more symmetric look.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	7.56	15.99	Everything is even, their eyes are even, their cheekbones are even, their nose even looks sharper even though when you saw them without make-up, it didn't look so good.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	153.59	157.89	My name is Sylvia Russell, and this is how you can narrow your nose with make-up.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	16.43	34.85	Well my name is Sylvia Russell and I'm going to show you how to narrow your nose using make-up. Narrowing the nose is something as a professional make-up artist I do a lot for people generally who are in photographs or on the set of movies like we are here today.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	35.46	43.45	We want the face to look as symmetric as possible, and so there are little tricks of the trade that we use to get that effect.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	44.41	55.23	So I'm using a concealer that is a little bit darker than her skin tone and I'm simply going down the base of the nose.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	56.57	68.57	Now using the correct color is very important and making sure the lines are straight is also very important.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	70.42	78.37	Once you apply to the outside of the nose, you can begin to see the lines as you create a thinner nose.
ejFkGiFzCaA.mp4	79.37	81.91	So this is something you should practice.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	27.23	44.72	Alright now, here we have our G. And oops, I forgot to do this. We'll go like this. The G is very much like the C. It has a distinguishing characteristic, however, and that is this stroke right here.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	117.2	118.92	Oh, what lovely words we have.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	119.38	124.32	Gentleness; having to do with the way that you're using your hand and the pressure in your hand.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	125.0	131.02	You don't want to expend anymore energy or place anymore pressure into your strokes than you have to.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	131.35	135.23	They're going to come out looking better that way and you're going to keep yourself from being exhausted.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	135.97	151.88	Grace; these letters are designed to be graceful and that's one of the beautiful things that the Romans gave to this set of forms when they modified them to this point of beauty.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	152.68	154.25	So grace for G.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	44.72	59.03	So you have first stroke coming around like this, and that is going a little bit straight here, and what you want to think about when you're making this straight curve right here is the fact that this stroke is going to receive this stroke.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	59.58	61.31	We call this stroke a beard.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	62.47	67.51	Anyway it's one, two, and then three.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	68.01	73.77	Now, remember that idea that we had, remember that principle that the eye tends to connect parts?
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	74.49	94.73	So what we're going to do is we're going to allow this stroke to start right around, right at around midway because we want to make sure that everybody knows that this is a G and not a C, so we have to give this, we have to give this enough, we have to have enough of this.
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	94.96	95.31	OK?
ejMrvmWZQkk.mp4	96.08	116.9	But we don't want to get it any closer, this stroke to this stroke, because we also want to make sure that everybody knows that this is a G and not an O, so there is the character of the G. Now let's look very quickly with our little bit of time and come up with some happy G words: gentleness and grace.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	0.29	3.43	From Tadasana to Standing Backward Bend.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	5.08	8.02	Standing Backward Bend is one of the most challenging poses that I know of.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	55.81	56.01	Up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	56.04	56.25	Up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	56.28	56.47	Up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	56.5	56.78	Up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	58.31	61.52	Belly is hollow and no one can say I'm doing a backward bend right now.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	61.52	64.11	My spine is completely elongated.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	64.11	65.19	Tail is rooting down.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	65.19	68.82	I'm going to squeeze my sitting bones together.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	68.94	72.98	You'll hear a lot about squeezing the sitting bones together in this program.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	73.2	81.17	Immobilization of the root. Pulling the root muscles together to give support to the coccyx of the tail. Then, I'm drawing the lower belly in.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	8.68	15.69	And, it's important to understand the support of the core in your Standing Backward Bends.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	81.17	87.49	And, I take the pelvis forward and I take the front of the pelvis up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	88.43	93.32	I take the ribs forward and I pull the arms back and up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	93.32	94.76	Mostly up, mostly up.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	94.81	95.84	Squeeze the legs.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	96.36	99.42	Now, start small and build up over time.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	100.47	108.89	Because, you want to preserve this absolute distance between the ribs and the hips with no pressure or compression in the lower back.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	109.75	111.38	Lifting is primary.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	111.83	112.7	Lifting.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	16.38	23.08	Very frequently, we'll bend backwards by pushing the hips forward and taking the chest back.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	113.13	114.04	Lifting.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	114.46	115.5	Still lifting.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	115.99	117.03	Still lifting.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	120.43	129.61	And, then you pull the ribs forward to come down and just balance right on top of your center.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	24.21	27.35	Or, we'll pull the hips back and push the chest forward.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	28.71	34.06	But, a true Standing Backward Bend everything comes forward and everything elongates.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	35.63	44.36	So, establishing it's called Urdhva Hastasana isTadasana with your arms over your head.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	45.56	53.13	Reaching the arms up, widening the ribs, drawing the lower belly in and you can see how that's sending some energy into my middle back.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	53.69	54.64	So, please not here.
ejNGhLlFbdI.mp4	55.03	55.78	Really here.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	2.32	4.66	Today, I'm going over how to make a kaleidoscope.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	24.46	28.2	We've got some transluscent beads.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	28.47	35.99	A marker, Exacto blade, some scissors and a hot glue gun.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	37.18	55.78	We're also going to use--what else have we got here--popscicle sticks, glass cutter (if you want to cut your own mirror), a transparency--gotta have that--and some tape and some old newspaper--gotta have some old newspaper.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	55.78	59.22	So, we'll go over those things and you can check out the list of the items you're going to need later.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	4.66	6.98	And, here's some of the things you're going to need.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	7.52	8.85	You'll need a mailing tube.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	8.85	13.07	Some directions call for a PVC pipe, but we're going to use a mailing tube.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	13.07	16.44	It's easier to find, cheaper, easier to work with.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	18.94	19.77	Some markers.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	19.77	21.65	Some glass mirror.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	21.76	23.09	These ones are cut in squares.
ejP2BaLTFGU.mp4	23.09	24.46	We'll also show you how to cut your own.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	0.64	6.82	Now we're talking about customizing your picture style on the Canon 40D.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	6.82	19.51	All you need to do is make sure that your camera is turned on, that it is active by pressing the shutter button half way down and then press the picture style button at the bottom of your camera.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	98.08	101.08	I'm going to go ahead and set it there.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	101.33	109.63	Now our sharpness has been changed one stop up, here from the original default setting.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	110.01	121.05	You can see that right next to the place where I've set the sharpness is a grade out marker for where the default setting was originally.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	121.62	142.5	Now if I decide that I don't like this setting, what I can do is scroll all the way down here to the bottom where it says default set and by selecting this button it will automatically return the settings of the portrait picture style back to the original settings.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	142.97	152.78	So if I select that, you can see that the sharpness setting has been reset back to its original setting.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	153.99	165.43	So if I want to come back up here again and change, let's say contrast and maybe I want to make the picture a little bit more contrasty and I move it up there a couple stops.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	165.78	168.99	Go ahead and press set, that changes the setting there.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	169.24	178.09	If I want to save the setting what I can do is just go ahead and press the menu button up here on the top left side of the body.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	179.12	182.33	Now that changes our portrait picture style.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	182.87	187.14	The contrast is now set to two instead of zero.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	20.21	22.88	That picture style menu will come up.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	188.23	194.26	I've selected that picture style, that's the style I want to shoot in and now we're ready to go.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	23.81	31.87	What you can do is take one of these preset picture styles, say portrait or landscape or neutral.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	31.87	39.7	What we're going to do now is just go ahead and use portrait and then press the info button which is right next to the picture style button.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	40.46	47.27	That will take you to the detailed settings of that particular picture style.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	47.85	55.24	There are four settings or variables in each of the picture styles in portrait.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	55.88	68.08	Sharpness has been lowered a little bit and contrast, saturation, and color tone are all sitting pretty much right at the middle.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	69.0	78.02	So what I can do here is scroll through, and let's say I just wanted to sharpen the photo, the portrait, a little bit more.
ejSRNVc3Qb8.mp4	78.9	97.07	In portrait mode you probably don't want your skin tone to be extremely sharp because it brings out all of the imperfections in the skin but in our case here we're going to go ahead and increase the sharpness a little bit.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	1.57	6.38	One of the best ways to make your skin look and feel better is to indulge in a salt glow.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	6.77	9.49	I'm Jackie Silver with how to give yourself a salt glow.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	47.19	50.57	Apply the mixture to a back brush and reach your back.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	50.61	51.95	Don't scrub your face.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	52.35	54.87	Rinse off the scrub thoroughly, but don't use soap.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	55.24	58.38	Dry off, leaving some of the oil on your skin for moisture.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	58.75	65.49	Remember, giving yourself a salt glow at home is easy, with a mixture of salt, cornmeal, and olive oil.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	65.79	71.12	Use it in the shower, avoid your face, dry off, and leave some of the oil on to hydrate.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	71.5	74.11	I'm Jackie with how to give yourself a salt glow.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	74.41	75.95	Have a relaxing day.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	9.89	16.63	You don't have to go to a spa to get this treatment, you can give yourself a salt glow with a few ingredients that can be found right in your kitchen.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	17.11	22.56	Mix together fine grain sea salt, cornmeal, and olive oil to the thickness of peanut butter.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	23.21	25.24	One cup should be enough for one treatment.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	25.61	28.44	For a coarser scrub, use more salt than cornmeal.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	28.61	30.86	For a more gentle scrub, use more cornmeal.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	31.35	33.63	Take a shower, then turn off the water.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	33.92	43.02	Starting at your foot, and working upward, rub the salt and cornmeal mixture into your skin in small circular motions with either your fingertips or a wash cloth.
ejaPxLlUnFE.mkv	43.55	46.56	Using your hands will make them smooth and soft afterwards.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	0.49	5.41	For this bead, what we're going to do is use another series of dots to create a distortion pattern.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	5.63	10.24	The end result of this bead will be a bead that appears to have stripes or lines on it.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	54.11	57.33	The colors I'm using I've used before.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	57.33	60.9	And these are kind of more festive, brighter colors.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	61.22	66.37	So again, as with any bead, you can use any variations of color based on your style and your preferences.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	10.92	13.45	For this bead, what I'm going to do is use black as a base again.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	13.58	14.75	It's one of my favorite colors.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	15.22	22.89	And we're going to use a coral color, a lime green color and white.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	23.45	34.35	And what this is going to do when we're finished, is it's going to have alternating lines of white, green, coral, white, green, coral, as well as some black lines showing through underneath.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	34.42	42.95	In order to magnify that effect and to stretch those dots out into those stripes and those lines, we're going to encase this bead in transparent clear.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	44.23	46.99	This bead can be made with various different colors.
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	46.99	50.48	I'm going to choose to make it with opaques today, but I've seen it made with transparents .
ejcXH2ppGVg.mp4	50.48	53.89	And it gives a really nice, gentle feeling.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	1.61	9.29	This segment on kids and golf is just to give us a generally feeling why kids play golf, why the like golf.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	9.32	17.76	I know why I like to teach them golf, for example, this is Gant and Gage Anderson, two youngsters who I've spent quite a bit of time with.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	35.81	37.73	And how old where you when first started golf?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	39.03	39.43	Two.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	39.79	42.53	And would you say that you've played a lot or a little?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	43.1	43.44	A lot.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	44.15	45.71	And have you played in tournaments?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	46.15	46.68	Yes.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	46.82	48.27	Have you won tournaments?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	48.5	48.98	Yes.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	48.98	50.11	You've won trophy's?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	17.79	19.37	They've taken a number of lessons from me.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	50.3	50.77	Yes.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	51.62	54.48	As you can see, I've only taught him how to say two words.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	54.48	56.59	One is two and the other is yes.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	57.61	68.39	Now, you've played other sports, but what is it about golf, you've, I know you very well and you're a very good golfer, and we're going to see some of your skills, but what is, what is the main thing you like about golf?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	68.85	74.42	That it's a really fun sport, and that's it.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	74.93	76.66	So it's really fun, and that's it.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	77.45	78.31	Well that's good.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	78.86	80.98	And over here, Gant, how are you?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	81.8	82.54	He's too strong.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	83.19	85.83	Gant, I know you've played in a lot of tournaments.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	19.7	22.88	But the main reason I like to teach them, see, watch this, watch this.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	85.93	92.21	And what is it, I know golf is fun, but what might be something else that you like about golf?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	92.32	95.07	I think, I mean, that it is so fun.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	95.1	100.56	I mean, it's a competitive sport and, I mean, it's just so fun.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	100.59	101.72	And you're how old?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	102.08	102.48	Ten.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	102.61	111.34	Ten years old, so we have ten and seven, and we're going to see their skills, but the point of this is introduce your kids and golf because it really can be fun.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	111.58	114.28	Come on, hands over here, hands, hands.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	114.73	116.45	Don't touch me, you little nuts.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	117.17	117.74	Great kids.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	24.53	25.94	He likes it when I do that.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	117.74	121.27	Gant and Gage Anderson, and we're going to see them swing real soon.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	25.98	26.3	And this.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	28.39	31.32	And that's why I like it, but in terms of them.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	32.1	33.06	Gage, how old are you?
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	33.83	34.39	Seven.
ejmjl2f8Zso.mp4	34.43	35.42	Seven years old.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	0.48	5.36	Hi, this is Jon in this clip we will be staining our project.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	5.93	9.51	The color of the stain that I've chosen is a natural color.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	77.15	87.83	Now if the project is a little bit lighter than you would like, you can always come back and put a second coat of stain on and that's going to darken it up a bit.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	87.9	97.54	If it's still too light you can always do a third coat or a fourth coat, or keep going until you get exactly what you want.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	98.39	116.05	Now you want to make sure that you stain those buttons as well. What I like to do is take my rag, put those buttons in it and just form a nice little pouch, then I'm just going to dip that pouch into my bucket of stain.That's going to coat them real nicely.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	116.05	123.37	You might need to do it a couple times and then make sure you lay those out to dry.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	124.78	131.97	When you're finished staining, you'll want to let the stain dry over night or at least for a couple of hours.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	10.01	16.75	It's going to keep the wood just about the same color it is, but it's just going to bring out the grain a little bit.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	17.44	24.46	I went ahead and placed just a couple pieces of scrap wood underneath my project so that I could elevate it a little bit off the table.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	24.74	27.54	This is going to help me stain a little bit easier.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	28.65	36.72	To stain my project I'm just going to take an old rag and soak it in my stain.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	37.9	39.97	I'm just going to rub that onto my project.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	40.35	53.7	Now you can see it's keeping almost the exact same color of the wood, but it's just kind of bringing out the grain a little bit and making it look just a little bit nicer.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	53.7	64.25	You're going to want to coat your whole project with a pretty thick coat of stain for first coat here.
ejthjhyOa_k.mkv	65.36	75.97	You're going to want to let the stain soak in your project for just a couple minutes and then just come back with a dry rag and wipe off any excess stain.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	1.47	3.32	So, we're learning the Bachata basics.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	3.97	7.02	We just learned the left turn, got to go on the right.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	51.28	52.17	Let's smooth it out now.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	53.29	58.87	Again, stepping one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	59.01	63.26	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	64.1	66.35	That's the basic Bachata right turn.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	7.02	8.38	Got to do the right turn, too.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	9.14	14.59	With the right turn, let's come out of a basic just so we're not starting out of nowhere.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	15.03	24.74	It goes, right, left, right, here's my basic, five, six, seven, here's the turn step, right, left, right, and, left, right, left, and.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	25.6	26.56	So let me break that down.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	28.1	32.72	Our basic, nothing changes, step, step, step, hip.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	33.28	36.83	Now coming into this right turn, you're going to step right.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	37.58	46.07	Starting into the turn, you do half a turn, step left, half a turn, step right, bring that foot in, plia, ready for the hip.
ek-SZDIRqc0.mp4	46.65	50.26	And, then we continue finish out the basic, left, right, left.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	0.96	11.31	Leopard gives you easy access to all your documents, your movies, your pictures, your documents, word documents via a process called Quicklook.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	11.86	18.21	Now let's say here I have an external thumb drive plugged into the computer and I have a whole bunch of documents.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	62.24	69.92	Now I can also do it for Power Point presentations and here you go, here's a picture for instance.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	69.92	72.43	It's actually text, but it's actually, it's a real picture.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	72.87	80.08	I can open up pictures, I can go into full screen mode and go back and add it to my library, but there you go.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	80.08	81.91	There's a quick glimpse of Quicklook.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	18.21	19.63	Here I see a word document.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	19.63	26.17	Instead of double clicking on it, and waiting for word to come open and then you can scroll through it, just hit the space bar.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	27.5	27.85	Here we go.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	27.85	30.95	This is your whole word document right here and you can scroll right through it.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	31.34	38.26	It works equally as well for video and also it works great for music.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	38.26	50.66	I can click here on the MP3, hit the space bar and there goes your music.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	50.79	58.24	Normally, you would double click on it, it'll open iTunes and then you would have to listen to it and then delete it out of iTunes library.
ek1OQONwxwQ.mkv	58.59	61.49	Here with Quicklook, you can just hit the space bar, it will quickly pop up.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	7.42	12.01	Now we have all of our veggies ready we are going to put this into the pan with the butter.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	13.41	18.26	So our butter is nice and melted here we are going to add the ham that we have minced up a little bit earlier.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	19.5	20.61	Put that right in the pan.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	21.07	30.86	We are going to put all of our veggies our celery, our red bell pepper, our fresh garlic beautiful, our onions we are going to add all this to the pan.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	32.32	45.15	This is probably going to take about 10-12 minutes you want the onions to be translucent a little bit and just kind of make all of your veggies a little bit soft.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	45.15	47.54	But it does not have to cook all the way through.
ek4-JDCrVpQ.mp4	48.32	53.2	You see all of these beautiful color and it is going to be all part of your stuffing.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	0.42	5.63	My name is James, Computer Training Coordinator for InterConnection and I am going to show you how to install a parallel scanner.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	6.47	9.37	The first step is you want to get your scanner and your cable.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	69.06	78.71	If that is the case, take your driver CD, if you don't have a driver CD you can usually google a model of the scanner, go on the manufacturer's website and download those drivers.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	79.14	83.08	After you do that your scanner should be good to go and you should have a good time scanning.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	83.53	86.82	My name is James and I just showed you how to install your parallel scanner.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	10.26	21.5	Just make sure you have the right cable ends your DV 25 or you can just if you are not sure you don't want to write it down you can always bring it on to your local electronic store and they'll know exactly what you are talking about.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	22.1	47.01	Once you have your cable hook one end to your scanner and take the other end and install it just the same on the back of your computer, being careful not to bend any of the pens, and then tighten in the screws to make sure it doesn't come loose.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	47.47	49.42	Once again these aren't a structural thing.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	49.42	52.4	These are just to hold this on there so you don't have to torque these down too hard.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	54.09	56.27	Now the hardware aspect is installed.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	57.08	59.26	After this all we have to do is turn the computer on.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	60.1	63.47	Whatever operating system you have is going t most likely recognize the scanner.
ek5Z6VvS2hs.mkv	63.96	68.79	Once it sees the scanner it may just recognize it off the bat and you can start using it or it might ask for drivers.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	0.22	1.75	CALAB LABARDA: Alright.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	1.86	3.14	Now, we're going to learn the wind up.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	27.52	28.79	You have 360 helicopters.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	29.12	48.74	Alright, so, again, from here, yah, okay, you can go to your x's, whish, bam, come across, one, two, three, come across, strike one, two, you want to thrown a 360, just go ahead, cross, spin above the head, one, two, okay, catch.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	48.74	52.26	Or you can be here, whosh, catch.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	52.57	53.93	So, that's called the wind up.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	53.93	56.81	From here, one, whish, bam, okay.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	56.94	58.42	Or you can do your hip.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	58.52	62.75	From here, wind up, remember this one, and catch.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	63.11	71.44	Okay, but I like to doing two, one, come across, and wind it up, whish, bam, catch, hip, bam.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	71.44	85.16	Or double, one, two, okay, three, and helicopter, whish, 360's, bam, alright, and that's going to look real nice in your form, and it's a good way to start it or end it towards the middle or in the end.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	3.17	3.47	Okay.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	3.47	8.55	You already learned this in the beginning of the series with one nunchuck, but now we're going to put two together and combo it.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	8.65	8.87	Okay.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	8.87	9.76	This is really cool.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	9.94	16.18	So, from here, this is your wind up from all the way around, hit, come back around, and catch.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	16.21	17.49	Now, let's use two nunchucks.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	17.49	17.96	Come together.
ek9RuMMQbRA.mp4	17.96	27.47	Okay, this one's going to go up now, yah, whined that with both, come across, strike, spin, come across, back around, strike, okay.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	0.44	2.7	Let's do our Double Twist on Releve.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	2.95	8.68	So let's start with the right foot slightly forward and the left foot back, belly button pulled in, chest lifted, shoulders back and down.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	38.27	43.87	And one, two; one, two; one, two; one, two; one, two; one, two; one, two; one, two; good.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	43.87	45.62	Make sure hands aren't flying around.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	46.38	49.56	Make sure knees aren't bent, turning into a Double Bump.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	49.7	50.99	This is a Double Twist.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	51.63	52.07	Good.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	53.22	53.33	Good.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	53.33	55.5	Let's try the other side, left hip.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	55.96	61.98	Forward, back; forward, back; left foot, right foot, left foot and up on Releve.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	62.25	74.23	Left foot, right foot; left foot, and double time. Left, left, left, left. Left hip is always keeping time. Left, left, left, left, left, left, left.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	8.94	9.42	Good.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	74.49	74.77	Good.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	74.98	77.81	Make sure drill in front of the mirror so you can do the moves correctly.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	9.46	14.07	Now the right hip's going to go forward and back, forward and back.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	14.16	18.94	So, forward and back on that forward foot and forward and then back.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	19.3	21.23	One, two; one, two.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	21.49	29.69	Now up on Releve, make sure your ankles are nice and strong, you can hold on to a wall or bar for balance if you need to, right foot, left foot.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	29.96	32.12	That right hip is always keeping time though.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	32.32	36.9	We're not switching hips, that right hip is always forward and forward in time with the music.
ekLBjK9Td-M.mkv	36.98	38.21	Let's try it double time.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	16.79	31.54	So the first thing that you do is click on start, control panel, then go to system, and right there it says the CPU I have.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	101.75	109.51	The one giga Ram that I had and then look at the video card right there it says ATIX 800 series it means that or better.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	109.81	114.94	Then VG force 6600 series or better or higher in video card.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	115.73	121.05	Right there on the bottom it says all the different cards that the game would run on under.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	121.43	130.0	So you want to be aware of that when you buy a game and here on the bottom I have a game that runs a little lower little lower specs.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	130.37	139.23	This one requires a Pentium four 1.6 gigahertz I got the 256 RAM I got that I 300 mega of space.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	139.67	151.07	Then it says GE force or greater so the specs in this second game is lower so it will run just about anything modern and then mouse and keyboard.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	151.62	155.04	So as you could see this is how you look, how you shop for games.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	155.46	164.11	You go to system write down what you have, take to the store, look at the bottom of the box and right there you could read and compare.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	164.69	173.06	You do not want to buy a game and then get home and find out that it doesn't run because store take games back.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	173.57	174.33	I have tried.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	31.54	38.8	I have a long 6400 1.8 giga hertz and it got to get in my computer has a giga RAM.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	174.66	178.71	So make sure when you buy a game that it will run on your computer.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	39.11	40.49	So write those things down.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	41.04	43.13	Now figure out what kind of video card you have.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	43.66	62.16	Again hardware device manager, display it after and right there it is I have a NV force 7600GT so write this things down and now I'm going to show you a box on the game and it would help you figure out if your computer can run it.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	63.74	67.59	Okay so here I have two really popular games.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	67.68	70.32	The Elder Scroll's Oblivion, really good you should buy it.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	70.88	81.82	But, normally you have a minimum system requirements in game boxes and they recommend don't ever go by the minimum because minimum means very very minimum it would barley run.
ekMXqZwIvDw.mkv	82.42	101.21	So if we look at the recommend on Oblivion 3 gigahertz Pentium or four equivalent in my case I have a Athlon 6400 3000 that runs on 1.8 gigahertz and in the case as the A and Ds you look at the name of the CPU Athlon 3000 so it performs as well as a Intel gigahertz.
ekPt59NbUD8.mp4	3.12	11.6	So first off your going to want to know if your goofy or regular what goofy means is that your right foot is going to be on the front when your skating forward.
ekPt59NbUD8.mp4	11.75	15.81	What regular means is your left foot is going to be on the front when your skating forward.
ekPt59NbUD8.mp4	16.18	21.49	There not really a big difference in between both of them it doesn't matter it's what your most comfortable with.
ekPt59NbUD8.mp4	22.49	30.56	And once you have your position in your stance your going to want to step on the board which ever stance you want.
ekPt59NbUD8.mp4	30.56	43.02	First and you want to put it probably an inch behind the bolts as long as you feel comfortable and then your going to step your back foot on and put it either on the tail or on the back bolts.
ekPt59NbUD8.mp4	43.9	54.5	And then your going to want to lean forward and backwards to get your balance and your momentum and once you have all that figured all out you can basically ride.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	9.04	13.0	Today we're going to need the following ingredients for this sweet bruschetta.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	57.96	65.09	This is the special stuff, this is a hazelnut spread it's called Nutella, get any kind of hazelnut spray you can get.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	65.47	73.34	This is what makes this beautiful, you're also going to use some cocoa powder and some powder sugar to go on it along with our mint leafs.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	73.43	74.7	That is it for ingredients.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	74.7	86.45	I mean it's easy we're going to chop up these nuts, we're going to slice up these bananas, we're going to toast the bread put the spread on it get it all mixed up, boom we're going to be back 10-15 minutes and we're going to be munching.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	86.45	87.86	I hope you're making this, this is sweet bruschetta.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	87.86	89.57	The kids will love you for it.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	13.8	28.93	The ingredients we're going to be using today we're going to need like a sour dough bread or a nice round bread this is a country round, an Italian round it's a little expensive five bucks for this piece of bread one loaf of bread, a little expensive.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	28.93	39.35	Also hazelnuts, you don't have to use hazelnuts but you see six bucks for not even a pound they're expensive as well but you're not going to use the whole thing; you can snack on them after.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	39.35	41.46	This is about loving, this is not really about price.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	41.46	43.73	You're going to love to make this for the kids and the kids will love it.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	44.03	47.9	You're going to need some butter, some bananas.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	47.9	49.69	Don't have to be completely riped.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	49.69	53.07	These aren't because we're putting them in the broiler it won't make a difference.
ekU-sgpP63M.mkv	53.34	57.1	We're going to use some brown and regular white sugar.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	0.38	8.48	A period of mild temporary insanity, understanding men and love.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	9.04	15.38	This is Dr. Paul, author of Boomer Girls, A Boomer Woman's Guide to Men and Dating and host of Ask Dr. Paul.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	75.84	80.74	Oftentimes, it's overcompensating for that feeling of insecurity that they have.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	80.74	82.36	They don't like to feel insecure.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	83.17	89.72	All right, if you understand a man in love, you have to understand that he needs reassurance.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	90.01	91.56	He needs reinforcement.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	91.91	100.62	Sure, he may be Mr. Tough Guy and all that, but down below, underneath that exterior that comes off so macho...remember the little boy?
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	102.05	104.92	It's still in there, and that's the one you're dealing with.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	105.32	112.16	So understanding a man in love, well, understand that little boy in him and you'll have a good understanding of that man in love.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	112.16	113.02	This is Dr. Paul.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	113.02	115.94	May your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	15.87	34.69	All right, yes, it is a little bit like being addicted, a little bit like being mentally off the edge, but understanding men and love, well, you kind of have to take those two items into consideration.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	35.98	38.62	We all have an addiction to love.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	38.74	39.87	We really have.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	40.19	45.88	That's a necessary underlying desire that all females and males have.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	46.38	57.29	When men are in love, then they need a certain understanding from the women that are with them because, oftentimes, they become very possessive to a greater or lesser degree.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	57.72	59.67	It may not be verbalized.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	59.67	65.65	It may be shown, and most often it is, and they need some TLC.
ekWucdgQxyk.mp4	66.23	75.46	I know they come off like macho, but oftentimes, that macho appearance is really there as a cover for how they feel.
ekaAd3A9I-Q.mkv	0.36	6.71	Hi, I'm Art Malov from New York Dating Coach in New York City, and I'm the author of Park Bench Dating.
ekaAd3A9I-Q.mkv	8.18	18.03	In this clip we're going to talk how to flirt without saying a word, and obviously you noticed I'm talking right now, and that's - it's crucial for this segment.
ekaAd3A9I-Q.mkv	18.14	64.51	But in reality is - sometimes you'll sit next to somebody and you know you might lock the eyes and you don't know what to say, or you just don't want to say, you just want to have some fun, and you know you can just look at her, and she's looking back, you know maybe sitting in a cafe or somewhere, and you can be like... and you're really just like having fun, you know, nothing serious, you don't try to reach over, just like relax like that, and you can be funny face you know, you can...sort of a very relaxed nonchalant and not saying a word.
ekaAd3A9I-Q.mkv	65.82	68.76	This is Art Malov and this has been How to Flirt Without Saying a Word.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	0.42	3.8	So let's talk about how to deal the game of fourteens.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	4.39	20.47	Well, what you're going to do, you're going to make with your 52 cards, you're going to make four stacks of 5 cards and eight of four cards.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	20.74	22.05	It goes a little like this.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	24.87	27.68	And as you can see, it takes a little bit.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	28.05	39.14	And it is at this time that I want to mention to you that if you don't like laying out all these cards, you can play this game online.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	48.61	53.36	But you can find this game on line.
ekgGdvhyE40.mp4	59.71	71.62	And here I am building my stacks and I'm going to keep putting out the tabloid and we'll pick it up in the next segment.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	0.64	1.33	ALLYN CHRISTOPHER: All right.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	1.33	3.12	It's time to put the other wheel on, the front wheel.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	27.23	28.0	Yeah.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	28.25	28.72	Okay.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	29.1	33.0	So, we're going to go ahead and put this back in the dry-fitting stage there.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	34.93	35.3	Okay.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	36.21	42.27	And then, now this is interesting, it does have the hex nuts in there but they've stayed.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	42.66	47.52	We are--we're using the old ones so those haven't knocked out during the disassembly process so, yeah.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	47.52	50.8	Why deal with the--why mess with a good thing?
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	50.8	51.78	So here we go.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	51.78	63.29	And setting this in place right there, shutting this there, so tricky, no, yeah, right.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	64.12	64.92	That's beautiful, all right.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	3.72	5.87	This way, we're pretty much going to repeat the procedure.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	64.92	72.68	Now, I'm going to get these started with the handheld, or the standard Phillips screwdriver, all right?
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	72.68	73.56	And give this one a bite.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	73.56	82.42	And I am putting my fingers right here underneath it to keep it 'cause as soon as that is pressured, then, it'll pop out, and you'll be chasing it around the shop.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	82.72	82.83	Okay.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	82.83	90.8	And to get these, I am just basically loosely fitting because we're going to have to balance these to the turbine but we'll do that later.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	90.8	94.54	And there you go, two or three of the four wheels.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	5.9	8.23	Make sure that I'm going to dry-fit it here, yup.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	8.57	10.89	You can see I'm making the bearing shield fit.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	10.97	12.63	Again, if I go the other way, whoop!
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	13.56	14.59	No, it doesn't fit.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	15.18	18.01	So it's important to use the one that fits if you got the choice, and you do.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	18.21	25.69	So, we're using the original piece and a brand new brass lock washer on here.
ekv1KjWs9dw.mkv	26.11	27.14	Slip it right in.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	0.6	5.9	Moving into a supine, which means lying down spinal twist.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	6.43	12.86	So, let's bring our arms out to the sides making a "T" with our arms about shoulder level.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	13.73	23.71	Taking a nice deep breath in and as well exhale, let's lower our knees towards the right side.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	25.95	34.01	Let's flow with this a few times, inhaling up and exhaling to the other side.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	37.14	40.48	And just flowing a few times from side to side with the breath.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	40.48	43.36	We are always exhaling as we are twisting.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	45.09	47.35	And, inhaling as we come back to center.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	47.96	54.21	Something that can be very helpful to some people with this supine twist is a yoga block.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	54.57	56.93	You can place that block on the floor.
elI403TmzZY.mp4	56.93	71.2	When it's time for you to hold the twist, you can exhale twisting to the side and then resting the legs onto the block if your legs or knees are not able to come all the way to the floor.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	0.62	5.29	So the first thing we are going to begin with is setting up a year round training program.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	5.77	21.76	And every athlete needs an off season so you should probably take at the end of your competitive season, four to six weeks to relax and train in an unstructured fun manner, where you do other activities that you may enjoy or things that you don't get a chance to do during the racing season.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	76.81	82.56	And that depending on your goals might be anywhere from six weeks to you know sixteen, eighteen, twenty weeks long.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	22.51	34.0	The next phase is kind of the prepatory phase where you start easing your way back into a structured workout, going on runs that are a little bit longer, start to introduce work in the gym and that will probably last four to six weeks.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	34.33	38.45	And the longest phase of training for most triathletes is the base training phase.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	38.73	41.97	And that needs to be at least eight weeks for athletes training for iron man.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	41.97	44.01	That might be as long as twenty four weeks of training.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	44.76	51.32	And during that time you actually build mileage and the emphasis is on duration of the activities and not intensity.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	51.66	60.64	The next phase is called the pre-competitive phase of training where you begin to raise the intensity and get ready to race, maybe even doing some lower priority races during that time.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	61.0	70.2	And that's usually going to be at least six weeks of training, at least six week block of time and perhaps as long as fourteen or sixteen weeks.
elJ-YrojPZU.mkv	70.3	76.51	And then there is the competitive phase of your season, where your emphasizing your races and recovering between those events.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	0.81	10.27	Working obliques with a cable pulley system is a good way to add in resistance for working your internal external obliques here, the girdle of the spine.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	12.08	16.63	It's not going to take a lot of weight to fatigue because this is not a big movement.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	16.97	29.53	With the front arm elbow, slightly bent in the front arm and in the back, we're going to control that movement from a diagonal position right down to the opposite leg.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	29.68	34.26	I'm actually working this side of the body when I'm hitting those obliques.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	34.26	36.37	For lateral flexion.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	37.28	40.35	Contract, and release.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	40.4	58.6	Again, keeping a slight bend in both elbows when I have my arms extended and not letting the body turn or twist, but keeping the feet hip width apart, and contract, and release.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	59.1	69.95	Now in order to work this side I got to switch it up, turn the other way, and when I'm beginning my point of attachment from this direction, then I'm hitting the opposite side, the opposite set of obliques.
elNMtKSS7_E.mkv	69.95	74.15	Working ten to fifteen reps, one to three sets, just like any other muscle group.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	0.98	4.66	This is a Live Oak tree another native to the State of Texas.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	5.21	8.55	It is pretty well an Evergreen tree.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	9.02	13.51	If you'll notice this is January and you will notice that the tree has green leaves on it.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	14.61	23.76	In another month most of the other Oak trees and other trees in this yard will start putting on their new leaves because they are truly deciduous.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	24.3	43.74	This tree will start dropping the green leaves that are on it now and replacing them almost instantaneously with new baby leaves that will be a lot of color but it will transition from a dark green to lighter green, back to dark green real quickly as it replaces the leaves that are on the tree on a yearly basis.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	44.07	48.68	It does it in the Spring and it loses them and replaces them all at once.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	48.68	52.07	It is truly a remarkable thing.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	52.07	55.33	The tree appears to be Evergreen although it does replace the leaves.
elQgk9Zsapo.mp4	56.03	63.33	It's not like a Cedar or a Pine which appears to be green year around without replacing the leaves.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	0.4	8.79	In this segment I'm going to talk about where you're going and where you're facing, and this builds upon the idea of the last segment of understanding the eight directions.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	9.14	18.7	So as we go back to the idea of the beginning of the form, I know I'm facing in the direction of the north, because this is where my belly button is facing.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	18.98	26.16	The idea is the direction usually is told by our legs; where we face is by where our belly button faces.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	26.4	31.29	So where I'm facing, in the direction where I'm going is all the same right now.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	31.51	39.0	But I know I want to go to the corner, so first I'm going to move everything to the side, to release the leg.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	39.35	46.7	Now, I know I'm going to be going to this corner, now I have a choice, I originally was here, and I'm going over here.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	46.95	50.68	But I have a choice, do I face here, or do I face here.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	50.98	60.88	In this case I'm going to face in the direction that I'm going, so that when I move forward, everything goes together, as in the beginning of our Tai Chi form.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	61.32	71.7	Now I'm here, and we're getting ready to go and ward off, I want to go back in the north direction, but I'm facing the corner, because this is where my bellybutton is facing.
elVb8s9ApEE.mp4	72.0	82.97	So I step in the direction I'm going, to the north, I move in that direction, but then I face in that direction, bringing me into ward off left.
elb5vwAX1rg.mkv	1.35	19.07	What we are getting ready to do now is to start our granny square so we take our yarn and wrap it around our finger to create the pretzel and pull this yarn right through here holding on to that end.
elb5vwAX1rg.mkv	19.13	22.03	There we go and we have our first loop.
elb5vwAX1rg.mkv	22.6	38.51	Okay so what we are going to do is make a chain of four so we are going to add that to here and pull that through, one, two, three, and four.
elb5vwAX1rg.mkv	38.91	50.33	Once we have those four we are going to leave the loop on our needle and not grab any more yarn, make sure it is tied and stick it through this very first one.
elb5vwAX1rg.mkv	52.39	66.03	Now that it is like a U you are going to pull this yarn through the two of them, put your finger through the middle and you will see we have created a nice little circle right in there.
elb5vwAX1rg.mkv	66.23	77.07	This is the base and this is where all your yarns are going to come underneath to create it to spiral around so we can make a nice square.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	0.34	7.46	But that is what you know, it's the quick way to make a, a linear kind of design.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	8.9	14.87	Again I remind you that ink comes in different colors so you're not restricted to black by any means.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	78.82	93.08	Let me see if I can you know, I might not be able to get that to happen again because this is all you know it's how dry the Shellac is and Shellac does dry very quickly It's dry in like five, five minutes or so.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	15.37	21.5	This is permanent, you can't lift it up or anything but it is a fun way to go.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	22.21	30.44	Now if you work on, you can get a stronger separation if you work on a smoother surface.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	30.44	40.89	This is foam core and it comes with a very shiny plastic sort of surface and so I'm going to put Shellac on that.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	41.02	49.86	This will see on, on the more plastic the surface of course the less that, the, the more the Shellac is going to stay.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	49.86	55.35	It's not going to soak in and it's not going to get dry quite as fast.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	55.35	67.81	And it's going to sit on the surface and sometimes that works better for your ink and you can try putting it in thick.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	69.01	76.67	You know there's nothing to say that you can't start designing you know by how you put this on.
elka3rIeVMA.mkv	76.67	78.79	Look what that's doing there, that's really kind of cool.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	0.54	1.48	My name is Ryan Wells.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	1.55	5.16	I'm an owner of a local fish store in Lindon, Utah, called Reef Runners.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	37.17	37.79	It's real simple.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	37.79	39.99	Basically, you just move the magnet back and forth.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	40.32	42.19	That's going to clean off your film algaes.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	42.71	47.46	There's another type of algae that you commonly get in a reef aquarium, or other salt-water aquariums.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	47.76	49.15	This is known as coralline algae.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	49.34	53.65	This is a hard, encrusting algae, mostly of a calcium carbonate composite.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	54.15	60.49	Usually, most of your algae magnets are not strong enough or abrasive enough to get rid of these different types of algaes.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	60.75	63.36	So, these are the two different types of algaes you want to watch for.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	63.52	74.25	For your film algaes or green algaes use a algae magnet, and for your calcium algaes or coralline algaes use use some sort of a metallic or an acrylic safe scraper.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	5.71	9.27	Some of the common maintenance on a aquarium is controlling your algae.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	9.84	11.44	You always get algae growth in a aquarium.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	11.44	14.06	It's a natural part of keeping an aquarium.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	14.65	20.29	Some of the best ways to get rid of algae on your glass, which is the most common algae you will receive is through use of an algae magnet.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	20.74	23.3	They come in different sizes, different colors, different forms.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	23.69	29.56	The main gist of it is you have two different magnets, one that goes on the inside of the tank, one that goes on the outside of the tank.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	29.56	33.33	On the inside of the tank there's usually an algae pad or some sort of scrubbing device.
elrpsLj15vA.mp4	33.33	36.77	Through the magnets, they clamp together on both sides of the glass.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	0.08	0.22	Hi!
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	40.78	48.84	Check to see on your plant when you buy it whether or not it requires you to put it in direct sunlight, indirect sunlight or even shade.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	54.98	59.3	A plant such as this one right here, this plant doesn't like to be in direct sunlight.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	59.77	68.01	You need to water it only about once a week because it is an indoor plant and because it doesn't get a lot of sunlight, the water is not going to evaporate that much.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	3.01	5.54	I am here today to talk to you about plant lighting.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	6.13	11.06	So now that you have your new plant, you are going to want to think about where you are going to put it in your home.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	11.34	13.37	Your plant needs light to grow.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	13.74	22.63	The reason that it needs light to grow is that sunlight touches the green part of the plant and creates a chemical process called photosynthesis.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	23.09	25.47	This is what gives the plant energy to grow.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	25.7	33.52	So besides needing water and some sort of nutrient like soil, it needs sunlight to grow.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	34.29	37.65	Now remember not all plants need direct sunlight.
em6sIyYgWTw.mp4	37.96	39.3	It is a very common mistake.
em8RLIB8V_4.mkv	0.27	3.81	A train travel throughout the British Isles is never too long.

emATsQJBGqw.mp4	0.06	12.08	We're just going to go ahead and just transplant nothing to it you just stick it in the soil and you can even cut these things in half.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	12.35	25.3	One of the things that ranchers found about when they first got to fooling with them here in the United States when it came to ranching purposes it's best to get rid of them.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	25.33	31.82	Because you can grow more grass if you don't have cactus they would go out there and pull these things up, cut them up and things like that.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	32.28	37.52	They found out to much as surprise that chopping them up basically just spreads them around.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	37.88	44.66	The larger pieces that get the right growing conditions would grow right back on even though you chopped it up in the fairly small pieces.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	45.88	70.52	For decorative purposes if you wanted a little more lengthy plant or a little more taller plant that would produce more of a say limbs and character without having growing off from one.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	70.59	86.2	You might take a couple of pads such as this or even if you had one that had say three pads and you can plant those just by taking that cut part letting scab over and putting it in contact with the soil.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	86.64	94.25	The soil needs to be kept moist but not soaking wet there again there is a lot of moisture and a lot of energy stored in the pad itself.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	94.84	103.78	The plant can go for a long time and look like it's not doing anything but what it is doing is down in here in the potting soil is putting out roots.
emATsQJBGqw.mp4	104.16	113.6	It's going to root itself down before it does anything that looks like growth as far as new pads or new growth above the ground, it's going to establish below the ground first.
emCreM04Fig.mp4	3.49	10.7	When you start working on the approach of the toothpick, you are going to want to go at a fairly medium pace.
emCreM04Fig.mp4	51.72	53.96	That way your body weight is evenly distributed.
emCreM04Fig.mp4	54.35	59.23	If they're anywhere else, you can be going too far side to side or up and down and you probably wouldn't make it.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	0.34	1.61	Hi, my name is Peter.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	8.03	12.73	In this section I'm going to talk to you about proper attire for running.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	13.34	20.33	You can do multiple things either have a nice fitted sweater if it's going to be cold outside something of a nylon material so it's breathable.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	20.61	28.48	As well as a tank top underneath and if it's not raining or if it's not cold outside, then just remove the sweater and have a tank top.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	28.95	33.29	You want that so you have that free hand and arm movement as well as shorts.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	33.29	35.14	A lot of people don't know what type of shorts.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	35.41	39.74	You don't need anything cotton because it will be too heavy and it will stick to you.
emGOZgLaZ_Q.mkv	39.74	42.07	You want something of like a nylon type of fabric.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	1.0	3.74	Hi I'm Tristan McCauley from Lucky Seven Tattoo.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	3.77	6.12	And I'm here to talk to you a little about keloids.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	47.64	49.21	And that will kind of help it dissipate.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	49.58	58.56	If that doesn't work or you don't feel like spending the money on tea tree oil, another thing you can do is make a mix, like a paste out of aspirin, and lemon juice.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	58.79	60.06	Or aspirin and saline.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	60.92	64.4	After you mix it together it should look something like this.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	64.87	75.94	Kind of a gritty paste, you take a toothbrush or take your finger like a real soft bristle toothbrush, and go around it, take that toothbrush and just kind of massage it gently.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	76.7	79.04	And you should see a difference in two to three days.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	79.75	87.85	If after a couple of weeks it's not going away after using all those options, you may want to consult a physician to find out what you can and can't do with it.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	88.67	92.28	But these are just a few of the things that you should know about keloids.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	6.72	12.09	What a keloid is essentially is a growth an overgrowth of tissue around the area of a piercing.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	12.83	16.84	It will show up as a small bump, kind of looks like a wart.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	17.71	20.52	A lot of people mistake them for warts but they are not.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	20.59	24.72	It's a keloid, it's soft on the top, kind of looks like a pimple and a wart put together.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	26.6	31.82	Basically the way to take care of it and make it go away, a lot of people use tea tree oil.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	32.4	39.09	Tea tree oil is kind of, is a very viscous fluid, you just kind of rub it on your ear or where ever it is.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	39.09	40.77	If it's on your nose, go around the outside of it.
emH7zqAn7hY.mp4	41.53	47.11	Just rub it in, kind of massage it around on the inside and the outside of the piercing.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	7.2	9.93	Now we're going to talk about the antagonist.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	70.19	74.06	Claudius is a smart villain, okay?
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	74.06	76.37	You don't want to have a stupid protagonist.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	76.62	81.23	You want to have some guy that--isn't very crafty.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	15.5	26.64	We'll picture Claudius, they're a lot more alone on Hamlet but Claudius is the antagonist of Hamlet in Shakespeare's Hamlet.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	26.93	32.73	Claudius is the person who has the most to lose by the character accomplishing their goal.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	32.93	40.03	In this case, Hamlet wants to take Claudius' life and Claudius, you know, obviously doesn't want to die like a logical person.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	40.35	47.04	So, each of these characters are invested in what they want.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	48.44	55.89	Now, Claudius, a good trait of an antagonist, is Claudius has the power.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	57.06	59.02	Claudius is the king of Denmark.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	59.27	66.85	Claudius has people in his back can call: Polonius, Laertes.
emNpWUvEKLA.mp4	67.78	70.19	Claudius has tricks up his sleeve.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	0.49	4.84	Hi, this is Oak at Painted Temple in Provo, Utah, we're going to talk about tattooing tips.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	4.87	9.63	A good tip in tattooing is, go to somebody who knows what they're doing.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	45.77	50.12	Find out what you want to get done, and you'll be a lot happier person in the end.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	50.19	65.42	Another tip to tattooing is, I can't stress this enough, if you're not qualified to tattoo, or you're not adequate, you know, with knowledge to tattoo, either go learn or get out of this world of tattooing, and I can't stress that enough.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	10.09	18.41	If you, you know, if you're for a tattoo or if you're out in the market for a tattoo, you really want to put your tattoo on your body, go around and look at portfolios, look at shops.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	18.41	21.38	You know, pay attention to floors, if they're dirty, you know.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	21.42	24.62	Pay attention to the tattooer, if they're dirty, if they're clean.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	25.02	26.24	Look at their portfolios.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	26.24	31.29	Make sure that they are what you want, you know,to have on your body, you know.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	31.29	34.71	There's a lot of tattooers out there, and there's a lot of styles out there.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	34.76	44.38	Don't be, you know, quick to a decision, don't, you know, what would you say, settle for a tattoo artist.
emOL7Zcopno.mp4	44.38	45.77	Go find your tattoo artist.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	10.79	14.72	This is more for a person who likes endurance, who likes to go farther.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	14.75	17.39	The crit races are more short races.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	17.75	23.32	The road race is typically going to be a 7 to 10 mile loop depending on the race.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	23.8	37.08	You are going to do a specific loop in an area and usually the roads are closed and depending on the distance, say you are going to do a 40, 50, 60 mile race, that will depend on how many loops you do.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	37.27	50.23	Obviously if you are doing a 10 mile loop and it is a 50 mile race, you will do 5 laps and in road racing it is so important to stay with the group.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	50.26	53.62	That can be the toughest race if you fall off from the group.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	54.04	64.63	You are definitely going to want to stay in the peloton and go the distance and hang in there because road racing is for the longer endurance.
emUf3GuervQ.mp4	64.63	71.95	I really really enjoy them and I recommend anybody who is going to get into cycling to go out and try a road race because it is a lot of fun.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	1.0	20.93	Your feet are your connection to the ground. Namaste. In yoga they call them lotus feet, because the lotus flower is a symbol of spiritual enlightenment and the stem of the lotus flower is connected down into the earth.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	72.43	74.46	Then we learn to play piano with our toes.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	74.75	79.49	So you're just going to try to place one toe down at a time on your mat.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	80.8	89.99	And then bring them up again and if you played piano with your little toes to your big toes then you try to do it the opposite way, pressing each toe down.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	89.99	108.77	Now this take some time. It may not work at first. But after your practice, you'll find you get better and you'll find you increase the space in between your toes, you increase the blood flow into your toes and you increase the grounding through your feet which is so important to support you through your life.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	110.83	111.48	Namaste.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	21.86	27.01	Our feet are the lotus feet, the part that connects us to the core of the earth.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	27.49	36.63	And if we don't stand right, then our knees aren't position right, our hips aren't position right, and you can end up having all kinds of imbalances, all kinds of back trouble or knee trouble.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	36.86	43.63	So it's important to learn how to stand correctly and how to give your feet some love.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	44.9	48.27	So I'm just standing with my feet about sitting bones width apart.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	49.09	59.5	I'm going to lift up my toes and press down through the ball of the foot both the big toe ball mound, the little toe ball mound, and also both sides of the heel.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	59.96	61.94	And notice how I have my toes lifted.
emVPaAgb7B4.mkv	62.94	72.06	So to learn how to separate your toes and get those toe muscles working because they've atrophied usually because we crammed them in the shoes.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	1.13	4.92	In this clip we're going to start looking at opposition repost.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	5.51	16.41	Now, I was being hit in the arm when I would attack him, so that's a good opportunity for me to grab his blade and then hit him while he can't get off the blade, and that's called opposition repost.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	45.53	47.22	So that can happen if he's smart.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	47.55	48.23	I go like this.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	48.23	48.61	Oh, no!
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	48.61	50.07	Now he's getting away from it.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	50.44	55.16	Now he's doing more technique than he's supposed to know, but most people are like that.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	55.68	57.47	Okay, so he comes over to hit me here.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	58.01	58.94	Ooo!
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	58.94	59.09	Oh!
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	59.09	59.64	Together.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	59.64	59.94	Again.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	16.68	26.85	When I grab the blade, it is a perry, or a block, and then I attack and in opposition he can't get off the blade, and I hit him, and only one light goes on hopefully.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	60.77	61.34	Comes to hit me here.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	62.53	62.94	Ah!
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	63.36	63.56	Okay.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	64.23	64.95	Comes to hit me here.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	65.86	67.7	Like that, very good.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	67.89	68.41	Comes to hit me here.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	68.8	69.28	Oh, no!
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	69.34	69.89	Don't talk.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	69.98	70.35	Come to hit me.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	71.14	71.7	See, like that.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	27.35	28.38	Now, we'll demonstrate.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	71.86	75.14	The idea is to grab the blade and hit the opponent.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	31.87	36.08	Let's say I attack him like this.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	36.08	38.08	He comes out to hit me with a stab thrust.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	38.08	38.99	I grab his blade.
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	38.99	39.39	Notice?
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	39.67	43.21	He can't hit me, and I go all the way and he hit... Oh!
emc6ohPsml0.mkv	43.21	45.34	He did get off and hit me at the same time.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	0.37	4.86	So, we're going to do now, another little jump sequence, kind of to the same rhythm that we did our shimmy to.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	5.13	9.55	This one's going to be two jumps in a row, but with like a thrust in between.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	52.74	55.47	So, he's going to give us a four count and then we'll go right into the jump.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	56.65	68.69	All right, so let's try that one more time with the drum.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	68.69	75.15	This time, beware of your hip thrusts, make sure they're on time.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	76.6	96.66	So, you just want to make sure that those are completely in rhythm, and, the people that do the really, really good hip thrusts, it sounds like the drum sound is actually coming from their bodies.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	97.05	103.09	So, the more on time you can be with those thrusts, the more believable it's going to be, and the more fun it's going to look.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	9.68	13.09	So, we're going to do our first jump, and thrust.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	13.31	20.51	Now, when we do our left to right,right, left, right, make sure your feet are together on the last one, instead of just your left foot.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	21.1	29.03	Right, right, left, right, together for your thrust, than a little prep step, right, right, left, right, together.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	29.73	34.83	And then we're going to do three, one more hip thrust, and than three more.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	34.92	35.99	It's going to follow with the drum.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	36.29	38.73	So, we'll do it once by ourselves, and then we'll try it with the drum.
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	48.39	48.56	OK!
emju8XTvIbo.mp4	48.56	52.44	It doesn't make much sense without the drum, so, let's add the drum and hear how that sounds.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	0.26	4.69	The next combination we're going to learn on the head target mirrors is going to be a three punch combination.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	5.1	11.98	We're going to try the left jab with a straight right, followed by another left jab, a harder left jab.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	12.39	16.92	All three times we're going to try to keep our head out of that mirror, okay?
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	16.92	18.53	So we're going to be that half a step back.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	19.21	27.45	We're going to slide in with the first left, bending at the knees, bringing our face right down about 8 inches below the mirror.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	27.86	33.1	We're going to follow through with the right hand, not quite as hard as the first right hand we did with a one-two punch.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	33.57	41.68	But again, our face is down out of the mirror, okay, and the third punch, the second left hand, is going to be straight into the face, again, of the opponent.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	43.21	51.15	And again, we're still back down here, and then as we step away our face will reappear in the target zone, their target zone.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	52.09	55.74	But because we're a half a step away, we're pretty safe at this point.
emmWdzGcLbo.mp4	56.22	64.16	So again, we're going to slide in with a left, follow with a right, then follow with another harder left, and then step back again.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	1.36	6.12	No one wants to go through life alone and today we're going to be talking about how to find a boyfriend.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	6.67	11.45	Hi I'm Joe Cuenco, I'm a Family Resources; and just how do you find a boyfriend?
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	60.59	68.71	Some folks are very successful meeting people at church or perhaps another option would be take salsa lessons.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	69.31	72.52	There might be an option for you to meet a boyfriend there.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	72.84	75.72	The last place that you want to meet somebody is at a bar.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	76.09	79.43	The hookup is not the way to meet somebody for a long term relationship.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	79.92	84.77	If that's what you're interested in, then take that route, but I wouldn't suggest that for a long-term relationship.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	85.34	99.58	Get yourself online, develop a face book profile, a myspace profile, that's a way to get out there and engage some of your friends, your friends know who you are, what your interests are and perhaps they can help you connect with somebody that has similar interests with you.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	100.1	101.79	So, you need to network.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	102.08	108.25	There's lots of association and lots of meetings that will have you an opportunity to get to know other people in the community.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	108.25	110.27	You can do some volunteering things.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	110.81	121.19	But, you have to improve yourself and your self confidence and therefore that will allow you to radiate that to a potential boyfriend and help you find that perfect boyfriend.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	12.12	17.57	Well before you can answer that question, you need to ask yourself what is it that you're looking for.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	122.74	128.61	This is how we find a perfect boyfriend, my name is Joe Cuenco of Family Resources Relationships For Life.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	17.82	23.82	What are your interests, long-term, short-term and who basically do you want to be with possibly the rest of your life?
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	24.58	26.45	Are you someone that's into sports?
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	26.84	31.44	Are you somebody that's into the arts, theater and what are your interests?
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	31.75	40.42	so you really have to define what your common interests are in terms of a partner and then really make yourself available in those venues.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	41.06	48.31	You need to join associations, you need to join clubs for example; if you're looking for somebody who love to play golf, join a golf club.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	48.68	51.08	If selling is your thing, join the yacht club.
emmyhILUVx4.mp4	52.09	59.3	Or, if you're just interested and perhaps somebody who likes to attend theater, well then, hey you know where to go.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	0.12	0.48	Hello!
emq0AYINleY.mp4	31.86	38.22	You still got flush possibilities, straight possibilities so you're going to want to see another card.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	39.45	41.13	Bam, you hit another 10.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	41.16	45.1	You now have 3 10s, which is a pretty good hand.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	45.98	47.79	You definitely want to stay in.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	48.15	50.26	You have a chance to catch a full house.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	50.26	53.95	You have a chance to catch 4 of a kind and you still have a chance to catch the straight.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	55.37	57.53	You definitely want to stay in with this.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	6.9	10.83	In this segment, we're going to talk about three of a kind.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	11.26	14.98	You're going to get your first 2 cards down and 1 card up as usual.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	15.37	17.55	You're going to go ahead and look at yours.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	17.96	20.39	Right now, you don't have much.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	20.51	22.98	You do have 2 to a flush, you've got 3 to a straight.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	22.98	26.85	You're probably going to want to see another card, and here comes the next card.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	27.32	30.7	You have paired your 10.
emq0AYINleY.mp4	30.7	31.86	You're looking in pretty good shape.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	0.58	3.97	Hi, I'm Jessica Smith with Blands Nursery in West Jordan, Utah.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	4.4	7.05	In today's series we're talking all about trees and shrubs.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	79.05	89.26	It may just be a simple thing where the leave may be just dried around the edges and that may be common as the plant sits there in that black bucket in the heat, but bring it up at that time.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	89.29	91.58	They should be able to tell you what is wrong with it.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	91.95	95.78	That bargain basement price may not be a good deal.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	96.54	106.45	Yes it's good to get maybe a year end clearance or an overstocked item on it for a discounted price, but also be careful on clearance items.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	106.6	111.08	There may be something wrong with the plant that may cause problems and concerns down the road.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	7.51	11.31	Right now we're going to discuss how you actually buy trees and shrubs.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	11.87	22.23	Well first off, what you want to do is prepare the area and make sure you've planned it so that you get plants, or you buy plants that actually will fit in the area at maturity.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	22.49	35.02	It's the number one mistake that a lot of people make is they plant when it's little and it looks good when it's little, but that tree may get sixty, seventy feet high in an area that can only have a twenty or thirty foot tree.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	35.4	37.89	So plan and prepare before you buy.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	38.3	48.78	Next off, go to your local nursery, go to one that is a reputable nursery and check out what their guarantee is because you'll want a guarantee.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	48.78	71.88	You are dealing with a living plant and a reputable nursery will have trees and shrubs that are usually of higher quality, true to name, they're shipped correctly, unloaded correctly, taken care of correctly and they're also going to have a knowledgeable staff that can help you and guide you through the planting procedures and any problems that may arise.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	72.09	73.4	Also look over the plant.
emqFQXc401s.mkv	73.95	78.71	If you see anything wrong with it or any concerns, bring it up at the time that you're there at the nursery.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	0.12	10.02	What we will be looking at in this segment is how to properly sharpen the spindle gouge and the spindle gouge has what is referred to as a fingernail grind.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	10.85	17.64	Besides being shaped similar to a fingernail you also have the edges of the grind that are brought up to the side.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	18.29	25.5	When you buy this skew the gouge is new and you will find them ground similar to the roughing gouge.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	26.09	55.29	To achieve this angle you take an adjustable jig and in this case I have mounted to the second hole which I have found to be the best to get the best angle with it, slip it in and I have a fixture set, that needs to be set at 1 and 3/4 inches from the point to the back and I have set this little jig fixture up so that I can do that.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	56.87	64.32	The jig is then placed in the foot, we'll mark our angle again.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	64.32	76.08	You place the foot of the fixture in this arm and then rotate.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	80.27	98.76	You don't want to spend a lot of time just rotating through the front or the sides if you were to rotate longer on the sides this point would become sharper and what that will do for you is get you to make very sharp points or very tight angles but you won't be able to make sweeping curves.
emqzlhrJIkM.mkv	99.19	103.21	You want to keep this at a radius similar to what I am showing you here.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	0.64	3.35	I've picked up my small 3/8ths spindle gouge.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	3.54	7.93	I'm going to roll a little bead in here and then we're going to put a little bit of a wire burn.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	7.93	11.17	A little burn area on each side of the bead to make it stand out a little bit more.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	12.03	14.83	Make sure you readjust your tool rest when you are working on a detail.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	15.35	19.79	You want to have as much control as possible right here.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	19.96	22.34	Rub that bevel and I'm going to come in right there.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	22.34	27.58	That's one side of the bead.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	27.58	29.39	Rub the bevel again.
emxXZK4-tzk.mkv	29.48	47.96	Now my bead has a little bit of a flat spot so I'm just going to lightly scrape.
emxrut1DYs8.mp4	20.88	24.7	None of them want to do that; $100,000 is a lot of money.
emxrut1DYs8.mp4	25.43	34.41	It's a lot easier to pay me $10,000 plus whatever expenses that may occur than what it is to write a check for $100,000.
emxrut1DYs8.mp4	35.21	43.46	All payments are made by check because the bail bonding company has to have a record of where their money is going.
emxrut1DYs8.mp4	43.73	50.17	Some of these fees are tax deductible and may be written off through the government and IRS purposes.
emxrut1DYs8.mp4	51.03	54.15	In most cases, you will not be paid in cash.
emxrut1DYs8.mp4	54.76	67.22	If you are paid in cash, make sure that you make a yourself a receipt because you need your personal protection at every turn whether it's from the bad guys or the IRS.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	0.66	7.84	The next thing we are going to do is attach the handle and I have used some playing cards here, so just want to put a little stamping on it to make it very pretty.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	8.08	17.45	I am using a stamp from the stamp set called "A Good Egg" and I am using "Pretty In Pink" which is going to be a tone on tone and I am just going to randomly stamp up and down the handle.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	18.06	27.86	Another way you can do this if you wanted to use these for table place cards, you could put the child's name or whoever your guests are name right on the handle and then just put them at their plate for dinner.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	28.62	49.09	Now you are just going to go in about half an inch on each end, poke another hole with your one sixteenth punch and then you are going to line up all your holes, put your brad in and then on the inside where your handle is going to be attached, you will just finish by sliding that in and spreading the prongs on the handle.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	51.13	53.85	Alright, and we are going to do the same thing on the other side.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	57.2	70.1	I like the idea of putting your guests name on the handles and then just putting them at their plate, it is a cute way to have your table ready to go on Easter dinner and everyone will know who they are sitting next to and it can be a lot of fun.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	70.1	72.16	Especially if you have some out of town guests.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	72.8	78.17	So the last thing we want to do here, I have my last brad in, I need to fill it with some goodies.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	78.2	84.86	I have of course some Easter grass and you just go ahead and stuff some Easter grass in so it looks all nice.
en1PBBlAt9E.mkv	85.11	99.92	You can use whatever color you want and of course what is Easter without chocolate, so we are going to put in some chocolate eggs and there you have it, cute Easter basket, you can use it for all your kids, you can use it for name place mats at your Easter dinner and have a lot of fun doing it.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	66.53	68.9	It's about four pounds a clay.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	68.9	70.62	I'm going to cut it right in half.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	70.62	77.16	For the two plates, I'm going to show you how to make.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	78.72	94.18	So we'll just take a little bit of clay from this one, about that much, just kind of slam it in there.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	94.18	94.57	Alright.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	95.65	106.03	So, they're about the same size.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	107.14	109.6	Actually, I'll take more off from this, let's put it over here.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	109.6	116.26	I'm not going to make gigantic plates, I want to go ahead and make a smaller ones.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	116.69	117.96	So those are the same size.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	119.01	122.76	So from here, we just want to get this guy centered and we'll take it from there.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	42.61	48.17	So we want to approach the plates at the same way that we did the bowl set.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	48.17	51.29	I'm going to use our tubal clay here.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	51.7	61.05	Now with plates, I like to use a little bit more clay, so you don't want to have a flimsy plate.
en2SO20nBZI.mkv	64.04	65.12	So I'm going to use this.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	39.21	45.73	Start on the 5th fret, we press down, we pluck it on the 5th and then we quickly slide up to the 7th, so it would sound like.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	45.98	63.69	Now, another thing that you actually might see commonly is just a forward slash up to any given fret in this case is 7th again meaning that there's not really a particular starting place or note that they want you to hear before that, but just that you want to end up on the 7th.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	63.69	67.73	So, I could really start anywhere and just kinda make sure I end up on the 7th.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	68.57	72.06	So, you kinda hear just that kind of like coming up to it sound.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	72.06	73.97	There's not really a particular starting note though.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	74.73	83.83	And then the other way that you might see it is a back slash and that's telling us that we're going to slide down, so in this case 7 down to 5.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	83.83	96.51	And then, of course, a back slash without a number in front of it indicating that we don't know exactly where we're starting but we're going to end up there at the 5, and we just really want to hear that resolution at the end.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	96.8	98.58	So usually, I'll just come up kind of fine just.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	98.91	104.88	You just want to make sure you can hear that at the end.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	104.88	117.36	So, that's 5 to 7, and here's just coming up to 7, and then just down to 5 from unspecified.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	119.26	123.2	So, four basic types of sliding that you'll see in guitar tablature.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	21.02	24.11	There are four different types of ways that we use slides on the guitar.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	24.69	27.8	You might see it notated like this.
en3zY52Yhyg.mp4	36.97	38.86	That was actually the first example I showed you.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	0.23	5.95	Another thing that is very important to mention is while you have your reptile in your home, make sure you're listening to the reptile.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	6.34	8.0	Now I know reptiles don't talk.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	56.2	57.11	Start spraying him.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	58.95	60.01	They speak to us.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	60.12	64.43	And part of your job as a keeper of this animal is to make sure that its properly taken care of.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	64.43	70.05	And that you're listening to it just as you would listen to a child in the things that it will tell you with its activities and behaviors.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	8.12	9.56	He's not saying anything to me.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	9.95	20.03	But when I say listen, I mean watching your reptile's behavior, watching what he's doing, just looking for things that are out of ordinary for your reptile or things that he could be getting into that are not safe for him.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	21.24	27.83	You want to be watching for listlessness or, you know, laying around and not being very active.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	28.24	34.56	You know these things can be indications of other problems, and it's important that you take those into account and nip them in the bud if you can.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	36.57	40.33	Your reptile talks to you on a daily basis every time he does something.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	40.86	44.61	If he's over on his cage licking the glass, he's telling you he needs something.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	44.84	50.87	If he's spending all this time on one side of the enclosure versus the other, he's telling you it's either too hot or it's too cold.
en9ADXJK4Mo.mkv	51.29	56.17	If he's spending of his time sitting in his water bowl, he's telling he's dehydrated and he needs more water.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	3.54	10.48	What we're talking about right now is the importance of these two linebackers in a 6-2 defense coming up against the run.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	45.14	52.04	Because if these two guys can't make tackles when they come through here, there's nobody behind them to stop the play.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	52.29	63.14	So its very important for these guys to read the play, react to the play, be able to come up, break down and then make that tackle and stop these guys.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	63.28	65.04	Because there's nobody back to help them.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	10.72	14.8	Now the main reason we run a 6-2 defense is to stop the running game.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	15.02	18.1	If you have a team that basically all they can do is run it.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	18.29	24.63	And you have no respect for the quarterback as far as dropping back and throwing deep against you, then you can run this 6-2.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	24.87	28.79	So its very important for these guys not only to be able to read the play.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	29.08	32.59	And the first thing they are going to do when the ball is snapped is, they are going to step up.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	32.88	39.13	And they are going to be ready to either get penetration in the backfield. Or they are going to be ready to break down and make a tackle.
enGVJxE22CQ.mp4	39.46	44.93	These guys have got to be fast, they've got to get to the ball quick, and they've got to be able to make tackles.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	0.37	5.77	To keep your dog and your cat from fighting it's it's never a bad idea to have your dog used to cats.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	5.77	22.83	That first four months of their lives are a great opportunity to acclimate them to cats so that they don't think that this is some strange animal they've never seen before, and be overly curious about learning about that animal; so your dog is, hopefully, used to cats.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	23.11	26.68	Then, you have to remember that dogs and cats are typically at odds.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	26.96	31.16	Cats appear as prey to dogs, and many dogs are driven to chase them.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	31.16	39.03	So, if you can eliminate the opportunity for the cat to run away from the dog then sometimes that'll resolve issues.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	39.03	49.04	So, have a place for the cat to go where the dog can't get to; a room, or a baby gated hallway, or something like that, and then very closely supervise your dog and cat together.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	49.36	57.39	Make sure that they're used to getting along, that they've met each other, that the cat isn't enticing the dog to chase the chase him or her.
enIF4n6AJNU.mp4	57.75	64.95	And hopefully, then you can develop a calm and relaxing relationship between the two different species.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	1.6	7.92	Hi my name is Rachel Youens and I'm a free lance fashion writer and the owner of austinstylewatch.com street fashion site.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	8.25	14.44	And today we're going to talk about how to dress for an 80's party or an 80's night out on the town.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	64.39	65.61	They're much more available.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	66.25	71.29	But leg warmers they give that kind of dancey, Flash Dance, Jane Fonda kind of look.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	71.77	75.02	But you can actually slouch these up against your ankles.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	15.01	24.98	So we're going to kind of draw our inspiration for these looks from movies around the 80's era and while there's a lot of 80’s inspired looks that you can probably go out to the mall and buy right now.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	128.51	137.36	And finally to top it all off, if you'd like to crimp your hair and mouse it out, kind of do the big bangs that'll really complete your Madonna, Cindy Lauper look.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	137.36	140.72	And for inspiration I recommend you look at Flash Dance.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	140.72	144.47	Take a look at, let's see Madonna's look.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	144.47	148.48	Cindy Lauper, Boy George, Flock of Seagulls.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	149.51	153.98	Take a look at some of those online and steal a little inspiration from those.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	154.02	157.3	So this is been how to get ready to dress for an 80's party.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	25.23	30.37	I'm going to kind of try to focus on things you might already have at home that you can modify.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	31.48	39.92	So the first thing we're going to look at for sort of a Flash Dance inspired look is just taking a t-shirt and cutting it so it hangs off the shoulder.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	39.92	46.44	And what you want to do to do that is just take the shirt and just cut slightly below the natural neck line that's already there.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	46.72	50.12	You don't want to go too far out to the shoulders or it'll just fall right of your body.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	50.48	52.97	You still want to keep a little shoulder so it'll hold onto you.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	53.92	59.83	And the next thing along that same Flash Dance line is leg warmers.
enMJ-hBqGco.mp4	59.83	64.39	Now we might not all have these at our house but they're also at places like Target now days.
enRuR45YphA.mp4	2.33	4.49	In this segment I'm going to teach you how to be a switch hitter.
enRuR45YphA.mp4	6.66	10.52	In this segment we're going to teach you how to hold the bat from the right side of the plate.
enRuR45YphA.mp4	10.75	17.38	Now like the left side, your control hand will be the opposite hand from this side and it will be your left hand.
enRuR45YphA.mp4	17.41	23.12	Your power hand will be the one above it and it will be your right hand holding the knuckles aligned.
enRuR45YphA.mp4	23.27	31.0	You definitely want to hold the bat the same way you did on the left side bringing the bat head up at an angle keeping the elbows in an A frame.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	3.56	10.29	A pin situation could often be scary and often if you are still in it, it is going to be something that is a little unnerving.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	10.9	12.87	But keeping a cool head is definitely key.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	49.04	54.41	It depends on the situation but if something doesn't work, don't keep on doing it.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	54.66	55.63	Try something new.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	56.34	65.03	Leave your spray skirt in tact cause pulling the spray skirt and filling the boat with water is going to make the pen worse most times.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	13.95	15.99	Once you are in it, there are a couple of things to remember.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	16.19	19.55	One try and keep your head above water at all costs.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	19.55	22.49	It is not a good thing to flip upside down and still be in the pen.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	22.85	24.27	That is worse than being heads up.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	25.32	26.47	Use your paddle as support.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	26.81	32.51	You can put it on the upstream side and lean off of it if you need to to stop your head from going under water.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	34.45	45.39	Once you make sure you are stable, you then want to start working your way off as quickly as possible and if that means jiggling a little bit, do that or pushing with the paddle to get yourself out of the pen.
en_wN3ToTTc.mkv	46.02	48.85	You may have to come off backwards, you may be able to get off forwards.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	55.26	59.33	There are some time released fertilizers that many of the herb growers use as well.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	59.69	63.88	Make sure it has a good amount of peat, pearl light and some sand so it drains well.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	64.17	68.67	Russian Tarragon will make a nice addition to many of your soups and palate and garden as well.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	68.88	71.52	For "On Gardening" I'm Stan DeFreitas, Mr. Green Thumb.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	28.39	32.86	If it is getting too dry, well you need to get out the watering can and give it a bit of water.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	32.97	44.47	If you start getting browning on the tips of the leaves well you know you have probably given it too little water so make sure you increase that water a bit if it starts getting a burned edge of the tip or the side of the leaf.
ene9Azb3WSc.mkv	45.05	55.26	The Russian Tarragon probably likes to be fertilized about every three or four weeks if you are using a water soluble and if not make sure it does get a good fertilization on a pretty regular basis.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	0.39	0.81	MICHAEL PLUNKETT: Hi.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	55.03	66.08	Anytime we're building what most people referred to as the 7th chord, specifically it's called the dominant 7th chord, you're actually going to have a flat 7th scale degree to build that.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	66.53	70.95	So, we've got 1, 3, 5 and flat 7.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	71.3	76.19	That's our dominant or just regular 7th chord you'll hear people refer to in both ways.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	3.87	14.45	We're now going to take a look at how we go about building a 7th chord from, again, our major scale using the same structure of building chords that we had previously using leaps of thirds.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	15.02	30.46	In this case, we're still using the C major scale. We take our 1, which is our C. We do another leap of a third that gets us to our 3, E. Leap yet another third just like we did before for building a major chord.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	30.86	33.55	That gives us our G, our 5.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	34.2	36.01	So, it's just like a major chord so far.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	36.01	41.69	We've got C, E, G. Now, in this case, what we actually do is we just add another leap on.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	42.05	46.71	So, that would give us our 7 which, on its own, would be the note B.
eng--FzOjYo.mp4	48.6	54.87	But in this case, we're actually going to add a flat to the 7 and that gives us the note B flat.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	0.35	6.64	Now we're going to take a look at measures fifteen to the end.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	6.64	11.7	And, we start with a C sharp minor, so that's our sharp one minor, right.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	55.88	64.51	So again we have our sharp one to our sharp five, to our regular five.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	64.54	70.52	And that brings us back to our one chord and it starts us right at the top of the two.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	14.04	16.36	So we get a little out of the major scale but that's okay.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	16.87	20.58	Then we have our G sharp minor which is our sharp five minor.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	22.18	25.07	And then we have our regular five seven chord here.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	25.86	32.55	Right at the top, remember the five seven chord is right out of the major scale, so this goes right back to our major scale pattern.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	33.66	35.21	So now, when we find these roots.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	35.21	37.93	We have C here, right.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	38.34	50.77	So we have, there's our one sharp one, and there's our five so here's our sharp five to five.
enhX-JZ7xVQ.mkv	51.37	55.08	And you hear how that wants to go back to one.
enjE8INeXDg.mp4	0.31	2.79	This is Kyle Hovercamp from Skatechurch in Portland, Oregon.
enjE8INeXDg.mp4	62.72	69.91	That's the natural thing is when you're falling try to stop yourself with your arm, but you can break your arm or hurt your wrist.
enjE8INeXDg.mp4	69.91	73.24	Something that I've done and it's not a good thing.
enjE8INeXDg.mp4	8.31	10.31	In this clip, I'm going to show you how to fall.
enjE8INeXDg.mp4	10.34	13.32	Skateboarding would not be skateboarding without falling.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	0.68	6.98	The next step in prepping the natural nail is to apply your bond aid which is a PH balancing agent.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	7.96	9.91	You want to apply this to all ten nails.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	63.22	69.1	If it starts to burn you can use a product called "Stop It".
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	70.78	74.98	And what it actually does is it stops nail primer burn on contact.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	74.98	78.84	It has Aloe Vera in it to soothe and heal irritated tissue.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	79.42	82.6	As long as you're not getting it on the skin itself, it shouldn't burn.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	82.6	86.31	And that is how you apply the bond aid and the primer to the natural nail.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	10.03	20.35	What the bond aid does is, it just kind of dries the nail out and make sure that there isn't any oils or lotions on the nail itself.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	22.09	24.37	You just want to apply this to all ten nails.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	30.01	32.55	You're also going to want to apply primer.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	33.78	42.17	Acrylic primer acts like a liquid adhesive, and all you're going to do is apply it to the nail itself.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	42.17	46.78	You don't want to get it on the skin or the cuticle.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	49.28	53.66	If you do, certain primers can actually cause a burning sensation.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	53.66	55.86	Not all do, but certain ones.
enkmH42kSW0.mp4	56.51	58.75	Just want to make sure you get all ten nail beds.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	0.38	7.84	Hi, my name's Jordan Dahl, we're talking about advanced floor gymnastics and the next thing I wanted to talk about, was getting ready for your competition.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	8.25	11.68	The first thing you want to do is, getting a routine together.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	80.05	93.37	This is something that's very common and I can almost guarantee you, that the intimidation that you're feeling, from that competitor, they're feeling back towards you, on some other scale, so don't stress yourself out too much on that.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	11.78	14.66	Finding out which passes work best together.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	169.56	171.58	You want to try and avoid doing that.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	171.82	183.29	You want to stay focused and stay visualizing, on your routine, really getting used to blocking things out so that you can focus in on your routine.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	183.39	189.84	Visualizing every part of it, in your mind, so that by the time it's your turn to compete, you're ready to go.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	189.84	192.6	Your mind and your body are both into it.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	193.29	204.3	Just a word of caution, during your warm-ups, you might want to skip the basic things and move on to the advanced warm-ups or the advanced tumbling skills, to start off.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	204.8	214.75	To kind of show off, I would recommend not doing that, because you can really injure yourself and completely destroy your chances for competition.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	215.04	217.72	Not only that day but for following competitions.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	218.46	231.54	You'll have your chance to shine during your routine, so be patient, warm-up, warm-up your basics, make sure you're ready to go, so that when it is your turn to compete, you are ready to perform at your peak performance.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	232.1	264.76	After you've completed, a routine that you can really be proud of, you've stuck everything, you've performed it like you've been practicing it, with just the perfection that you've been training with, that can lead to a first place medal and getting up on that podium and accepting that medal, for your hard work and your coaches dedication to your training, is just a feeling that's really hard to describe but it is worth any amount of stress and hard work, that you can put into your training.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	15.4	22.74	In the, earlier less advanced stages, they have routines that you need to do.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	22.84	38.66	They give you a set routine that you need to follow but as you go up into the higher levels, they call them optionals, they give you skills that you need to include but you can choose when they're incorporated and how much you incorporate that technique.
enmxj0wgap8.mp4	39.08	49.63	You'll need to find that list and make sure that you're putting in, your strongest point, so that you can show-off that point, that you have trained the hardest on.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	0.89	12.21	Hi, my name is Rachel of AustinStyleWatch.com and I'm also a freelance fashion reporter and today we are going to talk about why some gold rings turn your finger black.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	12.97	19.0	So, gold rings are usually not 100 percent gold.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	19.0	27.81	Gold is an incredibly soft metal and so in order to keep it strong and keep its shape as a ring, it has to be alloyed or mixed with other metals.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	28.72	31.97	So, you've heard of 24 karat gold, 14 karat gold?
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	32.44	40.64	What karat implicates is the percentage of the gold that is actually gold, and what percent is alloy.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	41.03	44.12	With 24 karat gold being 100 percent gold.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	44.35	50.3	So, it's often times not the gold that's causing a reaction on our skin, but the alloyed metal.
envTYRhoFJg.mp4	50.64	63.06	So, if you're finding a ring that's really turning your skin black, it's usually a ring that you've bought at some cheaper, it's costume jewelry, it's not as much real pure metal.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	0.5	4.76	So now I'm going to talk about how to determine what frame size is right for you.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	5.34	10.12	The best thing to do is go to a shop and get professionally sized.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	10.96	14.51	Usually they go by your inseam and the reach on your arms.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	15.03	21.36	But one thing you can look for is the clearance on the top tube and just how you feel on the bike.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	21.79	30.17	What I tell people when they come into my shop is we can size you up to right where you should be on a bicycle but you might not always be comfortable with that.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	30.61	40.28	When I used to race I always use to ride a bike that was a size smaller just because it's a little bit easier for me to throw the bike around off road and hit jumps with it.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	41.13	49.83	But when I was training and I was riding on the road, I would always get a bike that was a little bit bigger so I didn't have to raise the seat up and have more of my weight leaning forward.
envYjuYWvrU.mp4	50.5	55.43	So it's basically try a bunch of different stuff out and get what is comfortable for you.
envqCaBot0A.mkv	91.97	92.76	You just never know.
envqCaBot0A.mkv	92.76	94.43	It only takes a second here.
envqCaBot0A.mkv	94.43	97.41	So I'm just going to open this bag of gravel and pour it in here.
envqCaBot0A.mkv	105.69	108.79	The other reason that fish like gravel; it gives them something to do.
envqCaBot0A.mkv	108.79	114.37	You'll often find fish poking around in the gravel.
envqCaBot0A.mkv	114.37	115.66	It just gives them something to do.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	0.45	0.63	Hi.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	0.63	3.39	I am going to tell you about the real worlds of food and wine pairing.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	30.73	31.78	Flavors are fun.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	31.86	35.5	You can match them, you can contrast them, you can mix them, you can match them.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	35.94	37.81	However they are not that big of a deal.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	38.02	42.31	As a matter of fact they are the last think you should look at when you think of a food and wine match up.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	4.13	6.09	And I would like to talk to you about flavors.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	6.6	10.78	When most people think about pairing food and wine they automatically think of flavors.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	11.11	14.8	They think ewe I have got a spicy dish let’s get a spicy wine.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	15.05	18.05	Or I have got a fruity dish let’s get a fruity wine.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	18.71	22.28	Now those flavor matches are nice they are a good idea.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	22.68	26.09	But I am going to tell you the real truth about flavors in food and wine.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	26.92	27.58	Here goes.
enyT5qwPvLI.mkv	27.73	29.94	They are not that important.
eo3kKuIJnMQ.mp4	1.0	4.58	A slice is a common problem found in many golfers.
eo3kKuIJnMQ.mp4	4.95	11.33	A slice for a right handed player begins to the left and careens way to the right hand side.
eo5-uKG86rM.mkv	41.06	48.51	Stepping in with the right foot each time so we are stepping in with the lead foot and then stepping out with the lead foot first.
eo5-uKG86rM.mkv	18.53	21.6	And once we hit that one rung we are going to move onto the next rung.
eo5-uKG86rM.mkv	22.2	24.12	So Jonesy, do you want to slow it down for us?
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	0.97	2.99	Here we have a Peter Pan Collar with Trim.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	3.59	8.91	I wanted to show you this one, because of what I think about when I see this.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	9.88	21.34	The trim part of it, I felt that it was necessary to add that to show you, because don't ever forget the little details that you want to add.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	21.61	25.87	As far as in the past I've said, don't do the little things.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	25.87	34.25	Well, sometimes you do do little details, because sometimes that can make or break the inspiration behind your collection.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	34.61	41.05	A Peter Pan Collar is like we discussed before, the rounded, little girl, style collar.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	41.39	52.04	When you add the trim, it becomes completely different, so if you're trying to do a collection, and you have, say you're doing a collection, and every single shirt in your collection has a collar, and you're stuck.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	52.7	57.69	You can do a Peter Pan Collar and then you can do a Peter Pan Collar, and add some sort of a trim.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	57.91	59.58	The trim doesn't have to be like this.
eoA7EI7bQFk.mp4	59.84	69.01	The trim can be like loopy, doopy, doops, as opposed to like rickrack, or it could be like rickrack, zig zaggy, but it can be anything that you're little heart desires.
eoQXomIwfCU.mp4	0.4	5.12	Hello, my name is Scott, and I'm the owner of Climb On Indoor Rock Climbing Gym, in Wilmington, North Carolina.
eoQXomIwfCU.mp4	6.05	9.74	Today, we're going to discuss what I need to begin rock climbing.
eoQXomIwfCU.mp4	11.39	20.19	Because rock climbing is inherently dangerous the first thing that you would want to do is get the proper instruction from your local indoor climbing gym, or local instructor.
eoQXomIwfCU.mp4	21.42	35.34	Some of the things that are basic that you're going to need are rock climbing shoes, your harness, chalk bag, belay device, and a carabiner.
eoQXomIwfCU.mp4	37.53	44.56	If you get these basic tools, along with the proper instruction you can begin your journey in rock climbing.
eoQXomIwfCU.mp4	46.52	55.64	If you're bouldering you might want to also invest in a bouldering pad to soften your landings any time that you're bouldering.
eofeT_Fc4a8.mp4	48.19	52.1	Again, I've moved off my block, and I'm just sitting flat.
eofeT_Fc4a8.mp4	53.09	64.9	Usually after sitting for awhile, the knees will come down a little bit, and you'll have that good curvature to the spine, so make sure that you're seated equally on both sitting bones, and that you're beginning, by lengthening up through the spine.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	65.72	70.51	Another way to learn how to Manual would be to bring it to different lengths.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	70.83	82.48	One way that I learned how to Manual was I did Manuals in parking lots and I used the lines for each spot as a guide to tell me how much further I got.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	82.91	95.77	Another way that you could learn how to Manual is possibly finding something small like a crack to Ollie over and land in the Manual position.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	96.05	100.05	It's kind of a consequence free way and safe way to learn how to do it.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	100.47	106.31	If you don't make the Manual you can just set it down after and you can learn how to do it further and further every time.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	16.59	20.59	You can try to ride and see how far you can get.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	20.88	28.82	One way to do that is maybe learn it with someone else and kind of have like a Manual contest and see who can get furthest.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	28.82	30.72	That's one way to learn.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	31.14	42.05	You'll want to start of course learning the Ollie Manual onto lower surfaces like a curb or maybe a sidewalk in front of your house or something like that.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	42.21	47.2	As you learn those, start bringing them up onto higher surfaces.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	48.12	50.83	It's going to get more difficult as you get higher of course.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	51.96	60.83	One reason is that your body will be low and then you'll jump onto the top of the surface and your weight won't be correct.
eoukUnNuEoQ.mp4	62.19	64.96	That's another way to learn how to do Manuals.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	0.38	8.01	So once we've done Hero Pose, Vira-asana, and the variations, we're having a connection with this really long straight spine.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	8.79	13.24	We did Wide Leg Standing Forward Bend, we put the head down, the spine was inverted and straight.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	49.02	54.43	My ribs pulling up; so, I'm just pulling as many vertebrae up, up as I can, and boy is my belly working hard.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	54.61	56.72	This is really working, it's pulling in and lifting.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	57.67	62.29	As I continue in a Head Balance I'm going to be very careful not to roll.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	62.29	65.03	I'm going to stay right on that tippy-top of the head.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	65.29	66.4	Tippy-top of the head.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	68.3	69.69	Clasp interlaced hands.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	70.14	71.68	Pull them in around the head.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	72.02	73.19	Still strong in the belly.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	73.19	74.78	Now watch this transition.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	77.07	86.46	Turn the toes under, and I'm going to sequentially stack one vertebrae at a time over the one below it, which is the one above it if you know what I mean because I'm upside down.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	86.77	88.0	You know what I'm talking about.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	88.03	91.01	The head is stable, and the root moves.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	91.08	92.93	This is unique; this is unusual.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	93.55	94.81	The head is stable, the root moves.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	143.74	147.21	I'll catch you back here in a few minutes.
eoust9BXK2U.mkv	33.22	41.77	You put the head down, get your hips over your knees, put the head down, but instead of putting the weight on the head we'll pull up, engaging the belly.
eow5dHhk7ZQ.mp4	89.37	98.27	So, you can take your little white flowers and put them all around on that little bit of ruffled, white butter cream.
eow5dHhk7ZQ.mp4	48.13	59.82	I'm going to change to a larger tip for putting the butter cream on before we put the frosting, so I'm going to use a little bit of a star tip here.
eow5dHhk7ZQ.mp4	59.82	67.4	And then I'll pipe on just a little bit of a ruffle.
eow5dHhk7ZQ.mp4	67.4	80.28	You just kind of move, move the pastry bag just like up and down, a little bit, to give it a little bit of a ruffly look all the way around.
eow5dHhk7ZQ.mp4	80.57	88.62	That will cover up any mistakes that you have on the bottom, and it gives you something to stick your flowers to.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	50.87	59.78	Always secure it, pull it into the body and he's going to tuck as well because now, Brian has become the defender if he happens to come up within the interception.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	59.78	62.29	So, he doesn't want to turn the ball back over.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	62.56	64.86	So, Brian, hand up.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	65.05	66.62	Chris, hands down.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	24.63	26.41	That way, there's a reception there.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	27.09	32.83	It eliminates him having to jump to try and catch the ball in any other position.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	32.83	35.51	It's the freest most natural position he can catch it in.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	35.51	39.46	Now, Chris, if the ball is coming below that point, your hands are down.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	39.46	47.23	And this is probably where a lot of defenders may have interceptions where the ball has either been tipped, batted or it's just a bad throw.
eow6JPvo4vs.mp4	47.23	50.51	So, his hands are going to come down and catch the ball.
eox_vzpDm4k.mkv	0.59	6.56	So now that I've got my extruded pieces, I haven't let these set up at all, and I'm going to go ahead and start messing with them.
eox_vzpDm4k.mkv	6.56	15.61	But if you want to have really refined looking piece, you can let them set up to leather hard so that they're not going to get smushed in any direction that you don't want.
eox_vzpDm4k.mkv	16.57	28.47	But I'm just going to take a couple of these tubes, and hold them up against each other and once I see where they're going to connect, I can go ahead and score that area.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	0.96	8.42	The next step in making a silk corsage is to find out where she's wearing it, and what she's wearing.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	8.9	13.79	What you need to do is ask her is she wearing a strapless dress.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	69.6	76.06	All you would need to do then is lay it anywhere in your house and display it, so remembering the event you just went to.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	76.69	84.59	So the next important step in doing a corsage or boutonni?re is to find out where and what she is wearing.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	13.79	18.31	And then, of course, if she is, that means you're not going to be able to pin something on her skin.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	18.75	23.47	If she wants a wrist corsage, is it going to be on her right hand, or is it going to be on her left hand?
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	24.51	28.23	Depending on which way the watch that she wears, or any jewelry.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	29.5	38.59	She could wear it on her arm, which is coming into style, if it's a more casual, like for proms or homecomings or weddings, maybe, something that's a little bit less formal.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	39.05	45.24	You could wear it around your neck, with a ribbon around it, in a hat, or you can pin it onto a purse.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	45.79	50.95	So it's very important you ask them what they're wearing and how they want their corsage made.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	51.61	60.83	And it just makes it look like it's something that's really well thought out and put together as opposed to just buying something and slapping it anywhere you can.
ep-XnlwkBvc.mkv	61.32	68.77	It also helps the person hold it and handle it better, and take care of it, so that they can keep it later as a momentum.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	0.9	2.64	My name is Dorothy Schick.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	2.67	6.77	I'm a flight instructor and owner of TakeWING at Creswell Airport near Eugene, Oregon.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	60.73	62.46	I love flying taildraggers.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	62.69	66.74	So I fly from the backseat of old Aeronca Champs.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	67.05	73.08	I get to see people do all kinds of interesting things from the backseat and they have a lot of fun doing it.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	73.08	84.89	Probably the most fun I have is flying in a tail dragger and giving people their first, initial tailwheel endorsements, and that's a lot of fun.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	85.29	87.33	Landing at grass strips, a lot of fun.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	7.35	11.87	I think my funniest moments have been with my student pilots.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	88.09	91.42	So I've got a great job and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
ep105GKl6RA.webm	12.2	20.22	One, I can recall, decided at about 3,000 ft. that instead of pulling on the carburetor heat, he'd pull the mixture out.
ep1WD6mNALY.mp4	59.06	61.96	That is defense against an attack with a gun.
ep1WD6mNALY.mp4	26.65	28.74	It is going to break my finger because of twisting back.
ep1WD6mNALY.mp4	28.92	34.49	Then she is going to hit with the butt end of the gun to the head and then punch right afterwards.
ep1WD6mNALY.mp4	34.88	46.7	So again slow motion, grab the barrel, bring it to the chest, pull it back, breaking the finger, coming back, hitting with the butt end of the gun in the face and then punching in the face.
ep1WD6mNALY.mp4	47.0	50.8	This is what they do in the Burbank Police Department when I was there during their training sessions.
ep1WD6mNALY.mp4	51.27	59.06	So right here we have it from here, grab, twist, hit, pull it back, hit with the butt end of the gun and punch.
epU9DT7sr_E.mp4	10.9	22.07	The first trick to cut the beef very finely is to actually put the beef in the freezer for like 15-20 minutes.
epU9DT7sr_E.mp4	22.56	44.37	The reason for that is we don't want them completely soft at room temperature cause when the meat is really soft it is relatively hard to get a grip to cut a really thin slice you know so but we don't want them to become physically frozen either otherwise it would be hard like a piece of brick.
epU9DT7sr_E.mp4	44.87	75.09	So if they stay in the refrigerator for around 15 minutes before cutting usually that would give you a very good grip so make sure when you cut the beef the beef should be cut against the grains as you can see the grain is basically the texture of the muscle inside of the beef and they are relatively thick so basically you could see the lines relatively easily.
epU9DT7sr_E.mp4	75.55	85.61	Try not to cut following the grain because your beef not matter how tender the cut is it would turn out to be really really tough.
epU9DT7sr_E.mp4	85.8	95.45	Try to cut against the grain because the connective tissue they are not longer connective together and you would have much much tender cut of meat.
epU9DT7sr_E.mp4	96.05	105.0	You can also cut it in bias but I still recommend cut against the grain and it would give you much tender piece of meat.
epdkIFhnlKc.mp4	0.61	5.34	This is Patrick Munro, financial adviser talking about what is a tax sheltered annuity?
epdkIFhnlKc.mp4	5.68	25.42	A tax sheltered annuity is just that, it's a qualified plan, meaning tax qualified, that allows you to take money and put it away in the custodialship of an insurance company and while it's in that vessel, called an annuity, you don't have to pay taxes on that growth that is inside the financial instrument.
epdkIFhnlKc.mp4	25.49	36.06	And year after year, because of the fact that it's a tax sheltered annuity and you didn't have to pay taxes on it, your vessel and your money continue to grow larger, ever larger.
epdkIFhnlKc.mp4	36.8	41.74	That panacea ends at age 70 and a half.
epdkIFhnlKc.mp4	41.78	57.91	Once you turn 70 and a half, and every year thereafter the IRS has a formula called 'Required Minimum Distribution' and they put that upon your tax sheltered annuity and you are forced to receive a check and pay taxes on that.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	0.73	1.59	What is the magic?
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	1.62	3.55	What is the allure of belly dancing?
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	27.39	31.08	And I'm sitting here going "wow, that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen".
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	31.33	32.51	"How do I appreciate this"?
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	32.51	33.8	"Am I supposed to be watching this"?
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	4.22	8.85	Hi, I'm Johanna Krynytzky, with Hip Expressions Belly Dance Studio in St. Petersburg, Florida.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	9.41	12.08	So when you're watching belly dance, how do you watch belly dancing?
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	12.67	13.61	I didn't know this.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	13.65	19.13	I saw my first belly dancer when I was Istanbul and I was at a cultural show and out comes a belly dancer.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	19.36	20.56	I'd never seen one before.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	20.56	22.11	It was a very voluptuous woman.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	22.14	23.36	Not a thin woman at all.
epm1ogaJ6ek.mp4	23.66	27.05	And she had on a bra and a belt and beautiful skirt and a veil.
epmjkDuZjDQ.mp4	36.33	44.94	So, always make sure that, that's going to be a priority, that there's a trust factor with your instructor.
epmjkDuZjDQ.mp4	45.74	51.09	O.k, with special needs groups it's always important to never leave anybody behind.
epmjkDuZjDQ.mp4	51.3	64.91	You're going to have different levels of ability, and as long as everyone is having fun and you're able to really kind of work with whoever is struggling, and make sure that the other ones are still progressing and having fun.
epmjkDuZjDQ.mp4	65.23	74.06	It's not easy, it's pretty much the same challenge we have on any kind of a skiing or any kind of instructing in a group.
epmjkDuZjDQ.mp4	74.71	80.72	But, as long as, you know, no one is being left behind and they are all getting it done, that's the bottom line.
epwWVR_WRl0.mp4	31.95	33.46	OK, now we're almost there.
epwWVR_WRl0.mp4	34.1	41.77	You can see how this seam sorts of ends a little bit before, you see it kind of rounds off and comes right there.
epwWVR_WRl0.mp4	41.77	49.85	You want to do one more to make sure we have a good ending to make it easy to attach the other sides.
epwWVR_WRl0.mp4	49.85	51.93	So, we're going to go right there.
epwWVR_WRl0.mp4	52.89	64.68	But what I want to do, because this is a corner and we're going to be adding other pieces, is I want to go underneath here again, and just kind of reintegrate that right there.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	0.29	9.68	I would like to remind you to look at the characteristics that are involved with all the 12 Zodiac signs.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	10.58	21.89	Know that these are characteristics and traits that you can merge with or compliment your own astrological sign.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	74.12	85.19	Or you could Google Astrology on the Internet and it could tell you all about these signs.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	85.19	92.46	You could even Google Pisces or Taurus and any of the 12 signs.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	93.04	97.94	Look into it and look through the books.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	97.94	99.09	Look through the charts.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	100.17	101.61	Go on the Internet.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	102.2	112.56	The best way as an Astrologer and a Numerologist that I make my determination is by getting to know the people.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	113.62	121.0	Remember that we are all multi-faceted and that we all carry a lot of different energies as the universe carries a lot of different energies.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	121.49	129.17	I just find it to be exciting to be with all signs just that some signs I would not want to be with for long periods of time.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	22.19	27.46	Also, what is important to know is what your moon sign is and the ascended or rising.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	28.22	30.37	It comes down to choice.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	30.37	36.76	It comes down to your choice and your willingness to open up and have more tolerance and understanding.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	37.83	52.77	To look at this as definitive is not a good idea and I would hope you would want more excitement in your life to explore all 12 signs.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	52.77	57.85	And to be a part of the energies that each sign holds.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	60.05	61.66	All signs are exciting.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	64.09	67.76	One way you could do this is by getting astrological books.
eq-9CcAj-F8.mkv	68.2	73.42	This is one of the best it is written very well and it has all the information in it that you like.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	72.59	77.02	Make sure that the tip is adhering all the way down onto the nail plate itself.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	77.8	80.16	Squeeze in the sides if you need to a little.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	80.99	86.37	And if you're not careful, you could also glue yourself to the client.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	88.77	90.84	So, don't use too much glue.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	97.62	102.6	Now, some people, their nail plate actually curves.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	15.55	26.22	You just want to put a little glue right on the end and just glue the tip up to the end of the well.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	27.82	32.85	Now, these nail wells are actually cut out to go ahead and give her a nice smile line.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	33.35	34.53	This is the well here.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	34.53	39.54	If it has a full well, you actually have to cut it out or just use the whole thing.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	39.71	48.17	On the back it gives you a guide as to how far onto the nail you actually want to apply it.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	49.99	52.46	Double check, make sure you don't need to file any.
eq-kIVXzulQ.mp4	56.68	62.58	One side was a little too long so we just filed it slightly with the nail file.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	0.3	4.47	At last we come to the end of the lower case alphabet, the letter Z.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	4.47	12.91	The letter Z is kind of an, well I said T was an anomaly, so let's just say the letter Z is an odd letter.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	40.23	48.74	It's no longer at forty-five degrees, it's now at zero to make the spine of the Z, and then to turn it back to the normal slant.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	49.31	52.9	Which gives what I consider to be a more normal looking letter.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	52.93	57.0	It doesn't look cartoonish or Barnum and Baileyish.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	57.82	70.18	Now sometimes it's fun with the Z, see I'm turning the pen I'm thinking about it, to make a little bit of a flourish to the finish of the letter.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	71.24	83.76	You have to realize that the letter Z only occurs about once in every one thousand letters, so I don't think it's too much of an imposition to turn the pen for the Z.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	83.79	101.46	So there we are. The letter Z. I'll give one big flourish and then we'll be done. Z, last letter of the italic, lower case alphabet.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	13.09	18.13	So one, two, three.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	18.43	20.62	Now we want this letter to slant forward.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	21.28	24.62	Something funny happens with our pen here.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	24.75	25.65	See what happens?
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	26.12	27.9	It gets very thin.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	28.43	33.4	We don't have any of these thin lines for spines anywhere else in the italic alphabet.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	34.11	38.78	So it's my preference to take the pen and turn it.
eq2rbgmwPx4.mkv	39.04	40.23	See I've turned the pen.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	8.14	9.27	All right, we're back.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	9.27	16.48	I just chopped up my parsley, I'm going to just add it to my bowl, going to get a nice bowl put that all in there.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	17.19	29.71	I'm going to just take my lump crabmeat at this point, just put it on top of here; it'll actually help get up those little pieces of parsley, and just give it a chop like this.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	29.77	33.19	Look at how beautiful that crabmeat is.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	33.99	40.74	You want nice big chunks and that actually helps get that up, and we're just going to put that right into our bowl as well.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	41.52	48.3	So, all right maybe it didn't get up all the spots, I guess it did a little bit.
eq4eJgCgKV8.mp4	48.34	52.27	All right so there's our crabmeat, and there's our parsley.
eqO4Ic1gGZ4.mp4	12.33	35.04	Just lather it up in your hand, take a Q-tip while pushing with your tongue on the inside and go around the piercing with a Q-tip and get any of the buildup off of it and it kind of looks like when you have sleep in your eyes, that will be around the outside of it and what that soap does is break up any kind of bacteria and helps to dissipate any build up on the outside.
eqO4Ic1gGZ4.mp4	35.19	57.66	Then on the inside after you eat, drink or smoke for the first four to six weeks you want to rinse with an alcohol free mouth wash. You want to avoid spicy foods because that can also irritate the piercing and you want to avoid drinking alcohol, beer especially because the hops in the beer can cause an infection.
eqO4Ic1gGZ4.mp4	60.34	71.21	If you have hoop which he does not but you want to kind of turn it when you clean it going kind of back and forth and getting that build up off of it, just keep it really clean, keep it nice.
eqO4Ic1gGZ4.mp4	71.64	77.08	When you wake up in the morning and brush your teeth kind of go around it with a toothbrush to break up any plaque on the inside.
eqO4Ic1gGZ4.mp4	77.26	82.92	Just be very gentle with it and you should be alright and that is how you clean a lip piercing.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	9.27	13.74	Alright, so today we've talked about MyPyramid and things that go along with it.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	64.1	69.19	You want to focus on things like whole grains, a variety of vegetables.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	69.22	72.11	The darker the vegetable, the more rich in nutrients it is.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	72.77	77.72	A variety of fruits because different colors have different things in them.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	77.98	83.06	A few oils, most oils you're going to get throughout the day without having to even worry about it.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	83.67	88.25	Milk, remember, if they're four to five it's okay to switch from vitamin D milk.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	88.4	93.54	There's no reason for you not to give it to them if that's what they like, but it's okay if you switch them.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	93.94	99.16	And then with the meat and beans, remember this should not be the biggest part of your day.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	100.26	101.4	That's the new pyramid.
eqOXiPcP0VE.mp4	13.89	18.04	Like we said, remember the stairs were added to the pyramid for a reason.
eqS0qY6-aWA.mp4	26.18	34.73	So, while you're grinding you want to make sure that you're able to get it so that you're controlling it with an actual ollie to get it to come over front side one-eighty.
eqS0qY6-aWA.mp4	34.73	42.99	The other most important set up that you're going to have to remember is making sure that your shoulders continue in the one-eighty motion.
eqS0qY6-aWA.mp4	43.81	54.88	Getting this left arm, if your regular foot, to come over is the most important part of getting out, because if your body follows through, then your board will eventually come through also.
eqS0qY6-aWA.mp4	55.61	61.86	Another thing to remember is the back foot and making sure that the tip of your toe is on the tip of your tail.
eqS0qY6-aWA.mp4	62.45	79.46	This is the most important part of the smith grind, is making sure that you have total control of the board being all the way down and able to pop it to come up, because when it gets all the way down you're able to pop it, one-eighty, and roll away fakie.
eqS0qY6-aWA.mp4	79.46	83.69	That's the foot position for a front side smith grind, front side one-eighty out.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	0.89	4.64	My name is Christine Marquette and I'm a registered dietitian with the Austin Regional Clinic.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	4.64	7.86	And I'm going to talk to you about how to determine your percentage of body fat.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	38.51	42.45	Another method that's a lot more common is to use skin calipers.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	42.9	45.83	This can be fairly accurate if you have a good handler.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	45.83	57.11	If the person is very well versed in actually pulling the skin at the proper amount using the caliper to measure how much the indentation is various parts of your body.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	57.11	62.7	Usually they will measure your back, the back of your arm at your triceps, also the back of your calf.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	62.7	65.98	They may do some in the front, your lower abdominal area.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	8.27	10.78	There are actually several different methods to do this.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	112.65	115.46	You actually get a view of your entire body.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	115.46	122.08	You can see your skeletal system, you can see the actually muscle mass and then you can see the lighter parts that are the fat mass.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	122.38	124.7	So again, this is actually becoming the new gold standard.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	11.25	14.88	What used to be thought of as the gold standard was underwater weighing.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	124.7	127.43	The most accurate way of determining your body fat.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	128.2	131.78	There's a couple of estimations that you could also use on line.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	132.23	135.1	Something called the Navy Circumference Method.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	135.1	136.61	This is using a tape measure.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	137.23	141.57	You measure in men their abdomen, in women it's their waist and hips.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	141.97	143.85	Both genders also measure their neck.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	144.32	147.96	And you enter it into their actual website.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	148.06	153.66	You also put in your age and then the website actually gives you an approximation of your body fat.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	154.13	156.52	And then another website does a similar thing.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	156.52	163.94	However, besides using your waist and hips they also use your calf and they do not use your neck.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	15.36	19.48	However this is a very difficult way to actually measure your body fat.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	20.15	24.42	Typically what has been done is the person is submerged in a tank of water.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	24.45	26.67	They have to blow out all of their air.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	26.67	28.73	As much air as they possibly can.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	29.33	34.1	And their weight was taken before they were submerged and their weight is taken as they're in there.
eqbSHffFj2s.mp4	34.28	37.77	A calculation is done to actually determine their percentage of body fat.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	0.63	8.46	I have a color picture it's an oriental style picture whether you are doing black and white or color.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	8.46	16.71	It's really important to think about what you are putting around it, where it's going to hang, what's important to the picture to make it pop.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	17.84	24.46	There are things you can put down there that will just make the picture go away and there are things you can put around it that can make the picture just pop.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	24.49	28.49	We're going to experiment on what to do today.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	30.97	43.35	A chose a big black thick frame to give you a clue to as what not to do this, most oriental art has either a black or gold frame around it.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	43.6	50.25	They tend to lean in those two directions but you want to think about the ratio size verses your picture.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	50.58	59.41	As you can see this one is real deep and pretty big wide, I have a different one that is also pretty big it gives you some clues about what not to do.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	60.04	67.1	As I put that down on there the frame looks as big as the picture it's not going to give you a good look in the end.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	67.32	70.04	Cause of the fact that it over powers the picture.
eqc2Ef6zDxo.mp4	72.78	84.82	When you think about a little picture like this you probably want to think about something that mimics as well as it enhances as I put that one down on there it all became clear and it's quite nice to the eye.
eqiTkT1bwkk.mp4	0.91	1.29	DUSTIN STAAT: Hi.
eqiTkT1bwkk.mp4	5.6	13.06	In this segment, I'm going to show you more benefits of your new Xbox operating system--in particular, how to use a game trainer.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	0.46	3.84	Hi this is Sifu Tei continuing our series on womens' self defense.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	3.84	5.56	We are going to go through a third type of headlock.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	5.56	8.26	We are going to show you this from a different angle.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	8.26	11.3	So this person is grabbing from the side here.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	11.96	23.04	What you don't want to do is you don't want to bring your leg behind my leg and sweep because what is going to happen if I fold down now, your head is going to hit the ground so you don't want to do a take down at that position.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	23.43	24.88	So instead you do this.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	26.15	32.26	Bring your arm up to the shoulder, pull down and come in with the knee.
erMVAxzrvC4.mp4	32.29	34.8	So I am going to turn a little bit to the side so you see this positioning.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	99.26	100.56	Can you see it, isn't that great?
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	100.92	105.83	The Redwood Forest Trail, man they're just looking so neat and clean.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	106.22	117.47	Over here, Silver Bear with I can't even tell who that is but I'm sure he is important, look at this one, this is a great one, Burt Lancaster, look at that.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	117.47	118.63	He is so cool looking.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	118.66	122.39	His majesty O'Keefe, how corny is that but isn't it cute?
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	122.39	129.0	Over here we have got The Green Slime, is that The Green Slime?
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	129.19	133.07	Look at that it doesn't look like a horror movie but it must be.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	133.48	134.97	Oh look at this one, Tarzan.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	136.17	147.66	Now there's a guy with some abs, check that out, that's very nice and here is Apache Warrior that was when people made movies that weren't necessarily Indians but they were white people who were supposed to look like Indians.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	148.23	153.2	Over here there's a famous one, another Disney one, The Ugly Dachshund a Disney one.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	153.78	160.22	Here is what is this one, Nearly a Nasty Accident, whatever, with Shirley Eaton.
erPWTY_YDC4.mp4	161.09	172.53	The Black Whip, kind of like an S&amp;M favorite and these are just really popular especially the more colorful, the more kitchy, the B movies, the horror movies, they are all great things that people love them.
erPv1TcgAX8.mp4	1.02	8.61	In this clip I'm going to be showing you looking at the toes, looking at the feet what I'm going to be doing with this part of my thumb.
erPv1TcgAX8.mp4	8.96	21.52	I'm not going to be using my thumb directly but I'm leaning in and I'm pressuring using the bottom part of my hand, just the bottom part so let's call it the Southwest corner and the Southeast corner.
erPv1TcgAX8.mp4	31.93	34.63	I'm just pressing in, pressing in, pressing in.
erPv1TcgAX8.mp4	36.14	40.64	I can go all the way down opening up the foot.
erPv1TcgAX8.mp4	41.11	52.64	I'm using my thumb as little as possible, it is all done with the bottom part of my thumb, the bottom corner and I can do that also coming down the sides.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	41.85	43.45	You want to be careful because it's really really hot.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	45.33	48.77	If you want to pour it you can pour it out or you can use a spoon to get it out.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	49.18	51.87	I do it like this because it's a lot easier for me to do.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	53.01	55.28	Get a bunch of napkins in all that grease and just throw it away.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	55.98	60.91	If you want to spoon out the rest you can, but I'm just going to get napkins.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	61.27	63.96	You want to be very careful because this is so hot.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	29.22	34.14	All that grease is really really hot so you kind of want to just let it cool down for a little bit there.
erRReJGUTDQ.mp4	35.57	41.85	What I do is just grab a bunch of napkins and all that grease will soak that up in all these napkins.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	0.39	2.07	Okay, next step.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	2.27	7.3	We're going to come in here with a pair of pliers, and we're going to loosen this guy up.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	7.35	8.52	It's got to be removed.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	8.56	23.85	So, once we'll remove that, then we can come back and remove this little box around it.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	23.85	27.22	So let me set that over here to the side, and get rid of the pliers.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	28.42	30.95	Okay, now you can take this.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	30.98	35.85	You want to be careful here because there's gaskets right underneath this, where it mounts.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	36.25	38.55	And you want to make sure that you don't damage those gaskets.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	39.81	45.63	And this is where it's sometimes handy to have another hand to hold this over and out of the way.
erT3sk-JXb8.mkv	46.85	55.67	I don't have another hand today, so I'm just going to do my best to get it out of the way, which it's going to work right there.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	1.03	3.75	So there's a few different ways that you can purchase your paper.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	3.75	8.96	This paper, the length of this paper is 22 x 30 and this is kind of the way I like to buy paper.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	60.51	62.7	This is kind of a reason why I like print making.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	62.7	63.6	It's kind of physical.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	63.63	65.35	You're starting to work with your materials.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	65.35	71.3	You're not just taking a piece of plastic paper out of a box, you know, you really get a feel for it.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	8.96	12.47	This sheet probably cost me about four to five dollars.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	12.52	15.45	It's not too expensive, but it's not cut down.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	15.67	22.19	You could buy like a pad of this paper and it tends to be a little bit more expensive if you buy paper that's already been cut down.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	22.79	39.01	I like to buy paper like this and cut it down myself into individual sizes that I could use, and the first way that I do that is I just fold the paper over onto itself and I make a nice crease.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	40.52	43.17	And again you really want to make sure your surface is clean.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	44.49	45.87	This table will do.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	46.57	48.28	It's not the best nor the worst.
ereRZtTz2nQ.mp4	49.01	60.04	Once my crease is nice and even what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the edge of this table, or if I have a straight edge ruler, that actually works really well, I'm going to begin to tear the paper down.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	0.52	1.22	Hello!
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	38.81	44.1	Remember as you are adding soil to it don't make it tight.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	44.1	56.72	We want it to be loose because if you do that,what is going to happen is the root is going to go where it wants to go and won't have any pressure.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	57.02	57.66	There we go.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	59.21	59.68	Perfect.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	59.83	61.4	This is fantastic.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	61.45	77.49	And what we need to do is add a little bit more of the coffee grains and later on when you water it, the coffee grains has the acid and it is going to penetrate the entire plant underneath it where the roots are.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	78.79	79.49	Perfect.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	80.17	82.93	This is how we plant Gardenias.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	5.06	8.69	Now we are to that point, we can plant our gardenias now.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	9.15	10.63	We have our holes ready to go.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	11.11	16.14	We mixed our topsoil which is great and now what we need to get is get our gardenia.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	16.14	21.23	What we are going to do now is we are going to get some topsoil.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	21.67	23.89	We need to have some on the ground level.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	23.96	31.03	What we are going to do now is gently pull the gardenia from the container; there we go.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	31.03	34.15	It still has little bit of soil on the roots so go ahead and just put it there.
erfAkLIv03I.mp4	34.82	38.72	Use the remaining soil as well all around it.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	0.34	3.72	All right, folks, in this clip we're going to draw some animated clothes.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	4.06	7.22	Now, here's the amazing and awesome thing about anime.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	63.36	66.57	Now, that doesn't mean wander completely off the map.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	66.57	75.54	Allow yourself to have somewhat of a true sense of the character in mind in advance before you go in there and draw something absolutely crazy.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	75.54	84.73	Like he ought to or she ought have some sort of a trueness to themselves.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	84.73	102.08	But here's the thing, I'm telling you right now, even if for some reason--let's say you decide to abandon your original plan, when it comes to anime, no one will ever know--honestly, at the end of the day--what it is that is right or wrong in terms of the character.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	102.08	102.56	Why?
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	102.56	108.5	Because the anime world is absolutely limitless in terms of creativity.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	108.5	111.67	You can go and do absolutely anything you want.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	111.67	123.97	So what I'm doing here basically is I'm creating two different looks for two different characters based on, you know, early imagined character designs.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	123.97	129.15	I'm giving this guy kind of a crazier spacey looking battle suit.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	129.96	133.9	As we move down, we'll continue to build their look.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	7.46	17.08	For the most part, it is basically a chance for you to become a brilliantly courageous and innovative fashion designer.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	133.9	139.73	Like this girl, this skirt is going to end up being incredibly short.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	139.73	160.18	And she is going to be wearing some crazy boots--that honestly you would never ever see anyone wearing anywhere in real life.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	160.18	162.54	And that is the beauty of anime.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	162.54	164.83	It's not real life.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	164.83	172.01	It is fantasy, as we all know--hopefully.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	172.01	179.23	So we come down here, we can give this guy--hey, we might decide at the last second we want to throw some shorts on this guy.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	179.23	179.41	No problem.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	179.41	180.49	We can do that.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	180.49	182.83	And you know what else.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	182.83	185.15	Let's give him some boots too.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	17.31	17.8	Why?
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	187.4	196.46	Maybe he needs boots in his quest--I'm sure they all have a quest.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	196.51	199.87	Give him something interesting to do.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	199.91	200.85	Give them a pattern.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	200.85	204.98	Make them as brilliant and creative as you want them to be.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	204.98	205.94	The sky is the limit.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	205.94	214.64	So basically, my advice to you, if you're setting out to draw anime, is do not at all be afraid to think outside the box.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	214.64	221.73	That is where you ought to be when designing anime costumes.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	221.73	224.23	You ought to be a free thinker.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	224.23	231.77	You ought to be outside your head, and willing to explore beyond the limits of your imagination.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	231.77	233.17	So, go out there.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	18.46	21.21	Because the sky is literally the limit.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	233.17	236.18	Be your own little fashion designer.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	232.67	236.18	Draw your anime costumes, and have fun.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	21.21	29.14	If there's one thing that anime artists know, it is how to create incredibly visually interesting costumes.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	29.21	33.31	And literally, you should not in any way let yourself feel limited here.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	33.36	48.39	Like you should feel free to try the most random, absurd combinations you can think of--because you can.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	48.39	54.38	Allow your imagination and your creativity to run amok.
erisDaK2w4Q.mp4	54.38	63.04	Feel free to absolutely go crazy.
erntVVqNm8Q.mkv	0.29	0.61	Hi!

erntVVqNm8Q.mkv	42.23	46.74	A lot of time stagers are referred by real estate agents to work with sellers.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	117.94	119.62	In fact, let me do that right now.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	120.46	122.99	So I'm going to layer two and paste.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	123.48	131.15	And then when I place this on top of other fills, you can see that this is kind of just peaking through.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	131.49	134.71	Let me adjust this to fifty percent so you can see a little clearer.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	134.91	140.77	And now you can see that we've got this transparency going on here.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	141.14	143.09	You do that same thing for the stroke.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	143.81	149.62	And then finally down here we have a , and you can select radial gradience.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	149.62	151.1	In fact we're going to go through gradience.
eruIxp6rpwk.webm	151.14	154.99	Let me make another video that talks about that in this next section.
erxQDYrHUkA.mp4	50.79	57.4	So, maybe you can implement that water to calm you down a little bit so you probably don't need more fire.
erxQDYrHUkA.mp4	57.86	71.76	So if you are on the other side, if you are very calm person, low energy, you need that vitality and boost so you can implement more wood element and more fire element.
erxQDYrHUkA.mp4	72.02	76.52	So that will help you boost your creativity, vitality and energy.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	48.2	55.42	You don't return any phone calls after that, you don't date her, you don't see her as a friend, the communication is off.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	13.55	19.27	There's no going back, there's no trial periods, or any exhaustive type time limits.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	19.63	21.56	The bottom line, the break up is the break up.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	22.12	26.55	When you decide to break up with someone, the break up needs to be done quick and fast.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	26.95	30.03	You cannot have a sort of a break up, or a pseudo breakup.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	30.34	36.82	These all lead to asset problems, money problems, financial and emotional strains on both sides.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	37.22	38.71	Therefore, it's as simple as this.
es0ituUSAVU.mp4	39.04	47.97	You've decided you don't want to date this woman anymore, you have somebody else in mind, this is not the woman of your dreams, you break up in style, you do it quick, you do it fast.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	0.5	4.58	Just because your fish don't have sad puppy eyes, doesn't meant they don't need love.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	4.97	10.58	Hi, I'm Bruce with Aquatek Tropical in Austin, Texas, and today we're going to discuss how to care for your fish tank.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	47.44	50.09	Your light bulbs need to be changed regularly.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	50.21	51.94	Change them every nine to twelve months.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	52.21	56.46	This is especially important if you are keeping live plants or a reef tank.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	57.32	60.11	Wipe down the tank and stand as often as possible.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	61.06	65.12	You don't want dust or calcium deposits accumulating on the glass lids.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	65.5	68.02	That cuts down on the amount of light that you're receiving.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	68.96	77.43	Wiping down the stand also makes it look better but it also keeps moisture from developing in the stand, and that's the basics of how to take care of your fish.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	78.27	80.31	Until next time this is Bruce with Aquatek.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	11.33	15.07	Maintaining a tropical fish tank is a lot easier today then it was years ago.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	15.48	22.7	Advances in filtration technology and chemical interactions have made it easy for anyone to succeed with tropical fish.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	23.7	25.02	Few simple points.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	25.62	27.48	One, regular water changes.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	27.63	34.7	Once the tank has finished its cycling process, you'll need to remove about ten percent of the water volume per week and replace it with new water.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	35.55	36.67	Clean the filters.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	37.03	40.5	Even the best filters are only as good as the hobbyist allows them to be.
es1TJ65gkCo.mp4	41.11	46.3	Clean canister filters once a month and replace cartridge and hang on filters every three weeks.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	29.58	29.81	Good.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	30.05	32.48	So now as we come up, a couple things to remember.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	32.96	34.61	You want to move slowly.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	34.91	35.21	Okay?
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	35.54	37.85	You don't want to be doing this move very fast.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	37.98	39.14	It's not very attractive.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	39.17	40.05	So take your time.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	40.08	43.71	Up and push out and around.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	44.53	51.61	When you're doing arm movements solely for the sake of the arm movements and not just as a frame from your body, you can also watch what your hands are doing.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	51.81	54.33	That will guide your viewer's eye.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	54.94	62.19	Up and then pick a hand and watch it as it comes down, and then back to center.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	62.61	68.53	Again, come up, two, three, four, and out, six, seven, eight.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	68.59	71.22	Up, two, three, four, and out.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	71.22	73.12	You can also layer this with other moves.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	73.22	75.36	Up, two, three, four.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	75.48	77.54	Out, six, seven, eight.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	78.2	82.26	Up, two, three, four, and out, six, seven, eight.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	12.51	15.03	The arms are going to come up, elbows first.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	15.45	17.26	And you want to keep your shoulder blades down.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	17.54	20.2	As you bring your arms up, make sure you don't lose your tuck.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	20.65	20.94	All right.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	20.97	23.29	So coming up, all the way over your head.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	23.29	24.64	Keep your shoulder blades down.
es23wpfv-Xw.mp4	25.06	29.24	And then, we're going to push out and sprinkle down around the edges.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	71.52	81.75	The second factor being taste so if your not sure if your kombucha is ready or not you can take a straw open up your little kombucha, stick it and sip it and see if is the flavor that you like.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	82.25	102.56	The shorter the brewing time the sweeter the mixture, the longer the brewing time it would eventually turn in to vinegar which doesn't taste very good but you can dilute ti with juice or use it as a starter for other batches, or you can use all the ways that you can use vinegar as terms as household cleaning products, splash it on as a deodorant.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	103.28	110.6	Anyway that you might use vinegar I don't know anyone who put kombucha on its deodorant but it is a possibility all things are possible.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	110.83	113.91	But it does has a lot of uses so it is very versatile.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	35.32	37.23	How long do you have to let it ferment for?
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	38.1	46.11	About that is a good question it is it really varies and the reason it varies is first of all the temperature and second of all in taste.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	46.33	58.83	So a temperature the fermentation ideally refers to 77 degrees and if you wanted to you can control that by getting a aquarium heater and setting it to the temperature and putting that underneath and using a heating pad .
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	58.96	66.78	I'm a little more natural and I just go with the flow in the season, in the winter your going to want to ferment it longer I usually do it for about 3 weeks.
es38R3lfbN0.mkv	67.03	71.06	In the summer it is shorter 1 1/2 to 2 weeks 10 days is 2 weeks.
es3EFA_DOww.mp4	33.58	39.53	And any adult dog over the age of three to four can be fed only once per day.
es3EFA_DOww.mp4	40.44	51.96	This is just a rough estimate, please consult your vet, food bag feeding requirements or other dog professionals to make sure you're feeding your dog accordingly.
es3EFA_DOww.mp4	52.99	60.05	Generally speaking the feeding requirements on your bag label will tell you how much to feed your dog.
es3EFA_DOww.mp4	60.91	67.41	Like I mentioned earlier, if you notice loose stool, generally a good sign you're feeding your dog too much.
es3EFA_DOww.mp4	68.23	79.41	You also can give different additives such as yogurt, cheeses, unseasoned meats and fish to your dog's kibble, just to make it a little more attractive as well.
es3EFA_DOww.mp4	80.08	88.78	And finally always feed your dog at the same time of day, in the same place in the house, so they know its feeding time.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	0.67	5.4	Hi, it's Dow here at the Fire House Car Wash, and we're teaching you how to detail your engine compartment like a professional.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	6.03	10.13	Now we've already gone through the engine in a previous segment, checked to make sure that all our caps are on.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	55.51	61.96	Obviously I wouldn't want to put a hot plastic bag on a hot engine and melt and adhere to it and now we have a lot of work cut out for us.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	61.96	65.15	So I'm going to go in and I'm going to cover the alternator here.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	65.72	70.31	I'm just going to tuck this around there and make sure that we've got everything protected.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	10.16	14.52	And what we're going to do is any kind of water, solids, or anything into the engine compartment.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	14.55	20.67	Now we're going to go through and using something as simple as a plastic bag, this can be a shopping bag, this can be a trash bag.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	21.08	38.79	We've got these clear plastic bags that we're going to take and we're going to cover vital parts anywhere where there's a circuit board, anywhere where there's an alternator, that's an electronic parts, and of course, if you have an older model car, your distributor cap, carburetor, those types of things where we wouldn't want to get water in.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	39.21	43.07	Now it's important to note before we do this that we've got to make sure that the engine is cool.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	43.1	47.02	We don't want to wash, clean or detail a hot engine.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	47.22	50.73	This engine I have here is just a little bit warm to the touch.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	51.17	52.93	It was brought here several hours ago.
esCJJ340D-U.mkv	52.96	55.1	It's been cooled down now so we're going to be fine.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	42.53	46.26	If you make it the guy behind you has to make it or he's out.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	46.65	51.07	If you miss, the guy behind you if he makes it, you're out.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	51.53	54.02	If he misses, your both still in.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	54.05	61.27	Alright so, if I'm going first, If I make it, the guy behind me is got to make it or he's out.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	61.48	65.48	If I miss the guy behind me if he makes it I'm out.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	65.48	70.17	And the guy behind him is got to make it, if he misses then we are both still in.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	70.29	71.46	That's how you play knockout.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	71.56	77.54	It's played with a lot of people, it's a fun game but you got to make your shots.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	31.96	39.22	You put half of the players on one side of the half court at the top of the key, and half on the other.
esClPz8rHVQ.mp4	39.65	42.22	Everyone is shooting from the top of the key.
esFL0cr_EaE.mp4	12.52	25.21	Today we're going to be baking baklava one of my favorites and your going to need a couple of things so filo dough which is a very very thin pastry sheet you can find it in the freezer section of your grocery store.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	5.8	11.46	In this clip we are going to be talking about shaving as part of the mans grooming.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	60.17	63.66	For example you would shave down, down, down.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	64.24	70.74	If need to be if you like to get a closure shave you can relather and shave now across the grain or against.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	70.77	74.07	Just be careful when you are shaving against cause that can prevent ingrown hairs.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	12.03	22.32	What you want to make sure like I said before you want to make sure you have pre-shaved oil or get out of the shower and then apply pre-shaved oil and then go ahead and apply a hot lather.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	22.32	26.43	If you cant get hot lather good quality shaving cream would do good as well.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	26.73	31.36	Hot lather is good because it continues to opening up your pores even more.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	31.36	34.73	You want to go ahead and rub your hands together and go ahead and apply it to your face.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	36.49	39.97	Once you are done with taht you want to make sure you have a good clean razor.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	40.4	43.7	You want to make sure whenever you are shaving you use a high quality razor.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	43.96	53.54	A high quality means it will have at least two blades here and a handle that is relatively heavy that way you don't put extra pressure on your skin and most of the pressure goes onto the led.
esHKt3PXOjE.mkv	53.88	59.66	What you also want to make sure that you shave with the grain to prevent any ingrown which could be very palmated.
esRHFL2byHY.mkv	66.48	82.27	It always makes me feel a lot better when I stop and breathe and look around me and just become very grateful about everything that I see and knowing that its a gift to be alive and to be able to be physically fit to go out and hike and have a great time.
esRHFL2byHY.mkv	82.4	85.81	So take that moment and stop and smell the roses.
esZpwMl_dkg.mkv	33.43	50.34	And that is your front jacket length, from the shoulder seam in the middle, down through the chest and then, finally, coming to an end at where the jacket is going to stop.
esZpwMl_dkg.mkv	50.88	55.54	And I'll show you how that looks on a flat drawing so it makes sense.
esZpwMl_dkg.mkv	56.55	66.95	So what we did is we started it from the shoulder seam, right here, and then all the way down to where the jacket is to hit.
esZpwMl_dkg.mkv	67.45	75.6	So you want this to be specific, you can decide where you want it to hit; right here so from the shoulder down.
esbPXthEnYk.mp4	0.81	7.03	Here's a simple treatment you can do in seconds, to have silky hands and feet, for an important date or meeting.
esbPXthEnYk.mp4	53.19	54.69	Rub into hands and feet.
esbPXthEnYk.mp4	54.95	55.97	Rinse thoroughly.
esbPXthEnYk.mp4	56.27	60.05	Let the oil absorb into your skin, and then dry off.
esbPXthEnYk.mp4	60.67	64.74	I'm Jackie Silver, with how to have silky hands and feet instantly.
esbPXthEnYk.mp4	65.07	66.35	Have a silky day.
esg9X5OuCHQ.mp4	0.8	3.87	Hi my name is Lauren and I'm here to discuss how to cure beard dandruff.
esg9X5OuCHQ.mp4	4.34	8.15	Beard dandruff is usually your lower grade form of dandruff called pityriasis.
esg9X5OuCHQ.mp4	62.76	69.27	And you're going to want to watch also what you're eating, because you're going to have to eat very well balanced, and you're going to want to watch your stress level.
esg9X5OuCHQ.mp4	69.93	86.67	If you use a shampoo formulated for dandruff and if you maybe use one of the few treatments, of the home remedy treatments that you can get, plus watch your stress level and make sure you have a well rounded diet, that is one way that you can help and control your dandruff on your beard.
esg9X5OuCHQ.mp4	87.03	95.91	Another good thing is that transitionally our hair and our scalp changes throughout the seasons, so what may happen in the fall may not happen in the spring.
esg9X5OuCHQ.mp4	96.36	98.91	And that is one good way to cure beard dandruff.
esiKBVpzshc.mp4	3.8	7.31	Today we are going to talk a little bit how to care for your wig.
esiKBVpzshc.mp4	8.48	15.41	You know if you style it and you add product to it or you wear it on a daily bases you are going to want to wash it.
esiKBVpzshc.mp4	15.75	20.65	A lot of you don't know or are not aware it's is okay to wash your wigs.
esiKBVpzshc.mp4	20.92	22.67	They are not going to be damaged.
esiKBVpzshc.mp4	22.7	25.74	It is not going to hurt them in any way or form.
esiKBVpzshc.mp4	26.06	31.06	If you have a wig that has curls, the curls would pop right back up.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	0.3	1.56	Hi I'm Jeremy Blackwell.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	1.56	5.06	I'm here today to help you get started on your basement remodel project.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	80.83	83.93	There's many different ways to complete the drywall process.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	83.93	93.64	Some people here, they've hung the drywall initially with nails to tack it into place, but they've come back after and screwed the sheet rock on.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	93.95	100.52	If you use nails completely on this long piece of sheet rock, it's probably not going to hold as well as it needs to.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	100.55	102.1	So you want to keep that in mind.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	102.41	108.59	If you do hire someone to hang the sheet rock only and you decide to tape it, take that into account.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	108.86	116.35	Also take into account, how bad they're beating on the sheet rock itself because that leaves more work for you in the tape and texture process.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	116.49	125.1	One other reason that people use screws instead of nails is that these nails tend to work themselves loose during the settling process.
esmAG6A-n4E.mp4	6.24	16.43	After the framing, the plumbing, the heating and the electrical is completed and your insulation is installed, you're ready for everyone's favorite, which is the drywall.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	85.67	91.88	If they have a jean double seam on it, that's how you would repair it.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	93.05	99.56	It's just what we would do for our customers in a small dry cleaners.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	99.82	114.16	This is not a large operation as you can well know, but we are in the a small town and offer special services to our customers and that's why they come back to us.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	54.54	63.01	I have quite a selection of buttons and just oodles of them over here.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	63.01	65.37	I keep them all in my little thing here.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	65.75	71.52	And then I could just take my needle and sew my button on and cut the thread.
espLJOaa_eQ.mp4	72.31	85.67	A garment, if you are doing any altering, should be exactly the way the garment was put together, with the same type of buttons, the same type of seams, and the same as with jeans.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	65.73	69.47	Make sure you have pretty much everything well-planned out before they even show up.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	70.06	75.89	So once you have them where you want them, make sure again, you're very, very clear with them, very direct.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	76.73	83.61	Make sure you don't come across in any way as sleezy because basically, they're you know, putting themselves in your hands.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	83.61	85.9	They are trusting you to be a professional.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	86.25	92.42	So once you have them there, really then communicate clearly what your intentions are, setup the pose.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	92.77	101.98	Now once you have them in the pose that you want, make sure that you're very clear that you need them to stay relatively as motionless as possible.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	102.01	108.0	Try to make them comfortable, play some music, but as you're sketching, try to make sure that they don't move too much.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	108.23	117.25	Now the main reason for drawing nude models is to study the human forms specifically and the shapes and different looks that you can create with the human body.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	117.28	118.54	So really take in the form.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	118.58	129.46	Study it the way the light hits its study, you know, exactly, how, what it is you want to do also in relation to the drawing; like look at it and then translate it somehow in the best way possible onto the page.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	35.07	44.86	You're going to set them up in their pose, make sure they know where they're supposed to be, what it is that you're going to be doing while you draw, what like the idea with the shape and the lighting and everything, the scheme of the picture.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	44.86	48.92	Basically, the whole idea of the bit of painting or drawing as supposed to be.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	49.01	50.9	So you're very clearly on the same page.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	51.63	62.76	Next you're going to want to set them up and the pose that you want them to be in, make sure everything is setup pretty well beforehand in terms of lighting, in terms of where you want them to be.
etCwuoX-R7U.mp4	62.76	65.73	Don't make them stand around and wait for you to get your, your act together.
etDxbQazgHk.mkv	48.45	54.86	But we'll take a look at a hole that isn't well drained and isn't suitable for anything that isn't cypress trees or aquatic plants.
etDxbQazgHk.mkv	55.37	63.84	After we put some water into this hole, we'll find out if it's well drained or not, and then we'll go ahead and plant our plant and hopefully that'll all work out just exactly the way we want it to.
etDxbQazgHk.mkv	64.24	65.68	The right hole for the right plant.
etDxbQazgHk.mkv	34.73	36.58	In other words, it means you have poor drainage.
etDxbQazgHk.mkv	37.19	40.23	In this case, we know that this soil happens to drain quite well.
etDxbQazgHk.mkv	40.69	47.99	The plants on this particular site are all crotans and begonias, and they tell me right off the bat that this is well drained organic soil.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	1.19	1.72	TOM SMITH: Hi.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	1.72	2.67	My name is Tom.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	104.65	105.43	You just see it how it lingers.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	105.43	117.16	Or on the organ, this has got a--well, a simulated Leslie.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	4.87	8.93	We're talking about how to play keyboards in a worship team at a church.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	117.16	128.23	It just colors it a little bit better and helps it fit in, so that's a consideration.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	128.23	137.08	And then finally the sounds; make you like the sounds on the keyboard and to round it out for eight, the last one is new versus old.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	137.08	143.36	There's a money consideration there and the warranty consideration you just need to think about when you're looking at second-hand instruments.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	9.54	12.87	We're talking about things to look for when you're getting a keyboard.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	13.45	17.35	Some of the other considerations that I have on my checklist is brand name.
etNUmQ3y7RM.mp4	17.74	27.43	I'm not really into brands too much but at the end of the day, you don't want to have to service something--that is the company is no longer in business.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	0.65	4.54	Excessive urination is another problem that we can see in cats.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	4.88	8.84	It's usually urination that's confined to the litter box.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	49.44	54.29	So, if you're noticing this excessive urination please get a veterinarian exam for your cat.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	55.15	61.11	So that the veterinarian can decide whether your cat may need treatment.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	9.16	11.94	And, I'll show you how it looks.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	12.28	15.39	This is about a normal size urination for a cat.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	16.72	19.55	Your average cat will pee that much, maybe slightly more.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	19.85	22.35	This is a cat who would have excessive urination.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	22.73	32.28	And, as you look underneath with this non-clumping litter this amount of urine spreads even farther than it looks throughout the box.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	32.28	36.76	And, there's a pretty deep amount of litter that's saturated with urine here.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	37.74	45.27	Things to look out for when you have a cat who is urinating this much, are kidney disease and possibly diabetes.
etR9GJ0KXFE.mp4	45.8	49.44	Both of these diseases can be treated at your veterinarian.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	0.21	3.9	Hello, my name is Samuel Harvell, and I'm a personal trainer and running coach.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	4.37	13.46	And today, what I'm going to do is show you a series of leg drills that you would do before doing the actual workout, say, here on the track.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	74.6	87.99	The next drill is called the leg crossover, and you would start with bringing your left leg over, then the right, then the left, then the right, and then back.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	91.96	92.17	Okay?
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	97.87	104.85	You would do a count of, say, 15 going forward, and then 15 coming back.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	104.93	116.82	So for more information on the running drills I've just shown you, you can go to www.harvellfitnesstraining.com.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	117.41	118.42	That's H-A-R-V-E-L-L-fitness-training-dot-com.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	119.68	119.99	Thank you.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	13.97	25.77	And the process is you would go for, say, maybe a 15 or 20 minute jog to get your body warmed up, do some stretching afterwards, and do a series of what are called leg drills.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	25.8	30.76	The leg drills are...is an extension of the actual warm up.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	30.95	35.45	And so one of the first forms of leg drills is called the butt kicks.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	35.76	51.02	You have your hands to your side, and you're bringing your feet up like this, and you're going for about 30 steps forward and then you would turn around and go 30 steps forward again.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	51.08	53.05	So you would do that two times.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	53.7	62.59	Another drill is called the high knee skip, and it's similar to when you're skipping as a child, sort of like this.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	63.48	69.19	For the high knee skip, you want to get your knees up higher and you want to have an exaggeration with your arm motion.
etYniSHwu0g.mkv	69.88	73.12	Getting your arms up, up, up, up like that.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	3.34	6.45	In this next segment, we're going to focus on our fermentation processes.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	64.47	71.71	Once it hits about one bubble every six seconds, you're going to want to go through your first racking operation which is described in a later segment.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	72.86	77.3	Once you've done your first racking operation, the bubbling is going to go down significantly.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	77.51	81.55	Okay, at this point, it's going to be going into its second fermentation.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	8.72	12.03	Now that we've got our beer all ready, we're going to start worrying about our fermentation.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	127.73	130.94	Even if you didn't, you still may be okay as long as it's not still bubbling.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	130.94	132.49	And if you're lower, you're still good.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	133.93	140.34	The lager yeast strain that you used is going to want to be fermented at about fifty degrees, so the closer you can keep that, the better.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	140.83	142.27	So here are a couple of tips for doing that.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	142.94	152.05	First, you can put your carboy or your pail in a nice basic bin and dump some ice in there to help bring down the temperature, and some water.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	152.05	153.37	That will help stabilize it a lot.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	153.37	163.67	To make it a little better, you can add on a t-shirt and you can keep the t-shirt wet and that will help evaporate some of the heat as well.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	163.98	166.86	Another step past that, is you can blow a fan on that.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	12.45	18.37	So, for ales, we're going to want to keep the fermentation temperature between sixty and seventy degrees.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	167.23	169.25	And that will even remove more heat from that.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	169.76	172.2	Ideally, you'd like to put this in your refrigerator.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	172.23	175.84	However, this takes up a lot of space in there, it kind of knocks out all your shelves.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	175.97	178.85	So, this is probably the best way you are going to want to go about this.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	179.72	189.88	Now, to do the best lager that you can, what you'd like to do is after fermentation, start dropping the temperature by about one to three degrees per day down to about freezing (which is thirty two).
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	190.15	193.95	Don't worry, the beer won't freeze, it has alcohol in it.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	193.95	200.46	At this, you can let it sit there for a couple of weeks and it will give off the wonderful lager characteristics that you are looking for in this beer.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	202.06	208.26	However, if you can't do this, the beer is still going to come out fine, this just adds a little extra to it.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	18.85	27.69	You can go on the higher end for some of the higher strength beers like the IPAs, and also for the wheat's which will pull out a little more of the interesting phenolics.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	28.25	36.34	For lagers, such as a bock, or a pilsner, we're going to want to go as cold as we can which means we want to hit or aim for fifty degrees.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	37.05	46.9	So, with this, you're going to want to take your bucket, put it into a nice, relatively cool dark place in your house and let's start our primary fermentation.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	47.59	53.3	In about twenty-four to forty-eight hours, you should start to see your airlock bubble a fair amount.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	53.69	60.84	In about three days, your bubbling should be very, very vigorous, maybe even once every second or maybe once every two or three seconds.
et_CgR9T96Q.mp4	61.83	64.21	After that, it's going to start slowing down.
etfCZY0KRb8.mp4	3.22	7.71	This next game reminds us that the Lord fills our cups to overflowing.
etfCZY0KRb8.mp4	8.38	18.13	You'll want to divide your group into 2 teams, and then you will draw from a bucket of water, and then pour it into the next person's bowl.
etfCZY0KRb8.mp4	18.99	25.29	While they pour the water into each other's bowl to fill up the pail at the end.
etfCZY0KRb8.mp4	25.29	28.15	The first team to fill up the pail wins.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	0.19	10.27	Hi, I'm Gloria Campbell with Advantage Training Systems, located in St. Petersburg Florida, giving you some tips and techniques on how to write a cover letter for a medical assistant.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	10.35	24.14	Several things we want to make sure we include, our address, today's date, any employer information, and also a subject line or reference line in there for the position that you're applying for.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	24.4	33.97	The most important part though of the cover letter, will come in the body, and it will start with paragraph one that will say why are you writing this particular cover letter.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	34.05	43.75	You want to make sure that you include some reasons why you enjoy being a medical assistant, why you chose that as a career or a profession.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	44.17	46.99	You then will move on to why are you qualified.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	47.53	51.37	If you've had some extensive training, make sure that you put that there.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	51.69	61.49	If most of your training has been on the job, make sure you include some key words like, "I'm a fast learner", "I love doing things differently", "I love working with people".
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	61.82	73.32	As a medical assistant, you are key to making sure that that office runs efficiently, you need to translate that in your cover letter, and don't forget to summarize and close.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	73.65	81.68	And I'm sure that you will get that next job to that next level which will be your resume being reviewed, and an interview.
etgsogw9f4s.mp4	81.99	87.01	My name is Gloria Campbell, with Advantage Training Systems, located in St. Petersburg Florida.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	0.04	1.92	Now I'm going to talk about bloom boxes.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	2.12	4.34	I'd mentioned these before as great centerpieces.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	44.87	47.96	There's also... let's see, what sizes are these?
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	47.96	53.29	There's six inch, there's eight inch... they're just a great way to add colors and flowers to your bridal shower.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	4.62	10.27	What they are is a cardboard box that is just folded up that you put flowers in.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	10.43	12.08	Sounds really easy, and it is.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	12.32	18.24	You can use fake flowers--you know, the artificial kind--or real flowers.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	18.24	21.92	We just used the roses that we have here in that.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	21.92	29.61	These are fake wooden roses in that little box, but you can also use fresh flowers, because they come with the little bag inside of them.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	29.61	35.02	They come in many colors, and the instructions are right on the box.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	35.02	38.31	There's different sizes and everything.
ethIbn6Jz8g.mp4	38.31	44.17	You simply open the package, open up the bloom box which goes into a square.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	0.71	3.05	OK, we're getting ready to do the very top layer.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	3.47	5.46	You can do as many layers as you like.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	55.55	56.62	We will get to that later.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	57.7	65.46	And I'm going to take this first piece, judge it compared to where that first layer ends right there.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	65.46	69.2	I'm going to make it just about half an inch shorter.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	69.2	75.54	And that's right about where we want it, so I'm going to keep that cut.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	76.33	83.65	Also there's a few strays, so I'm going to grab this piece again and get those long hairs.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	84.95	85.35	There we go.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	86.27	99.42	And now we can move right along the head, continuing to use our previously cut hair as our guide and get this style nice, even and complete.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	5.46	10.69	I like to stick with three, personally, with my own hair and with anybody's hair that I cut.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	12.49	17.68	And you want to make sure you're going with the natural part of the person's hair who you're styling.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	18.09	21.24	Hers is just a little bit to the side, mine is directly in the middle.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	21.82	27.75	But it's whatever works the best for your client or your friend, whoever's hair you happen to be cutting.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	28.82	36.63	OK, and you can see that right now her very top layer of hair is about even with the layer that we just cut.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	37.45	41.1	So we're going to change that and make it just a little bit above it.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	41.67	49.83	So we're going to grab our scissors and our comb, but we're going to use our fingers to get through.
ethWrgFt5LM.mp4	50.48	54.45	Now, since the front of her hair is stylized, I'm going to leave that alone for now.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	0.77	11.09	This is where designing becomes a lot of fun for me is when I take a step back and take a deep breath and say alright I don't have to produce any certain thing.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	11.42	17.15	I am just going to let myself design, let myself blindly draw and that is when you can have the most fun.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	17.15	23.89	If you don't have any restrictions, don't have any parameters then what you create is completely and intrinsically yours.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	24.13	33.47	It belongs to nobody else, even if it comes across looking kind of dumb at first, kind of weird, that can be the whole point of your collection.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	33.67	62.92	Like here I have my asymmetrical theme and I let myself just think of this in about 30 seconds but it has become one of my favorite things that I've ever done and I do want to produce this in actual three dimensions and wear it because it's the way that the lines follow the body and the way that it accentuates and minimizes at the same time is perfect, perfect, perfect.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	62.95	64.19	I cannot say enough about this.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	64.25	76.38	That is when you know that you are truly happy with something that you've already done is when you cannot wait to reproduce it in actual fabric, when you say, oh my god I've got to make that so I can wear it tomorrow.
etnm9NnnMKg.mkv	76.86	82.87	That is when you know that you are on the right path and that everything you are doing is truly, truly something you should be doing.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	0.64	4.83	Shopping for an adult saddle can be just a little bit easier than for youth.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	5.24	10.13	As an adult we typically stay near the same size for a long time during our riding career.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	66.36	78.09	It's going to hold them securely, the stirrups will go up and down to their degree, you can even get fenders and stirrups for a tall, lean person that would be custom made to go with that fifteen inch seat.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	78.42	90.47	So when you're looking for a saddle, and you getting in it, you want it to feel comfortable, appeal to you in the way it sits your body, keeps your seat bone secure, and also ample room so that you're not feeling crowded in that seat.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	10.7	15.11	We still want to look though at the body size of an adult as we start to decide which size seat.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	15.59	21.46	I have an adult saddle of a fifteen inch variety, a sixteen on up to a seventeen.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	22.06	30.64	The seventeen inch saddle will carry an average size man, but I have seen some men who have in fact gone into the eighteen inch variety which I don't keep.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	31.12	41.33	But a seventeen inch saddle you can see is very generous to the seat, the stir fenders are going to be long enough and allow the rider to have a long stretch in their leg, if they are in fact a tall person.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	42.32	45.13	This is a sixteen inch saddle, built a little differently.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	45.46	49.58	But it has a heavy fender, and it's going to hold a rider in a secure position.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	49.95	57.01	And be for a person probably about my size, kind of your average woman, a little bit larger woman might find that comfortable as well.
etsBD53yVoc.mp4	58.04	65.99	When we get to the petite size person, a very small framed lady or as we talked about a teenage rider, a fifteen inch saddle is going to be their ticket.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	0.2	2.74	Hi, I'm Stan DeFreitas, Mr. Green Thumb.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	2.95	6.7	This plant is called the Torenia, or sometimes called Wishbone flower.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	62.49	65.07	For On Gardening, I'm Stan DeFreitas, Mr. Green Thumb.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	7.03	8.81	Now, it makes an excellent bedding plant.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	8.92	16.57	You can use it as a plant that's from one area to another, like a transition plant, or you can use it in a window box, or you could use it as a bedding plant.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	16.92	25.25	Torenias really excel, they don't have very many problems either as far as insects or fungus, this plant really is a toughie roughie, if you will.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	25.72	34.79	This one's dried out just a tad, but it's one that you can give it a bit of water, and even though it looks a little bit wiltie, it'll come back out and flower about ten months a year.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	35.2	45.21	Good water soluble plant, food about every week, every two weeks, and this little Torenia or Wishbone Flower will flower continued throughout the warm season.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	45.24	56.26	Now, you wouldn't plant it during the winter season, but as early as your frost free date in spring, all the way through to the fall, this plant should flower almost everyday of the year, once it gets to a mature size.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	56.54	59.39	And, they'll get to about a foot, eighteen inches tall.
ett9ADfupAY.mkv	59.73	62.2	Torenia is a great bedding plant in your landscape.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	0.55	12.93	Also known as fish houses, ice houses, or shanties; Ice Fishing uses many different types of shelters in order to take us in inside from the elements.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	13.39	15.9	They range from the simple to the sublime.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	16.2	31.35	Simple; something like, as the great pumpkin here will demonstrate, a simple sled; all the way up to the most elaborate shanty, which may be a full size trailer on sleds.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	32.6	47.51	You can see here that the basic sled is fit with a piece of plywood, half inch to three quarter inch, and special cut to fit into certain grooves which are in the sled, here and in the back.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	48.38	70.91	The sled is tipped up on its end; the plywood is inserted into those grooves, checked for security and then one fisherman positions himself out of the wind, directly over a hole, and directly prepared to jig.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	71.34	76.56	The shelter is now covering me from the wind, which is circling around from behind.
euC0FFmfdeU.mp4	76.59	81.85	This will greatly reduce your time and fatigue on the ice from the wind Bradley.
euE0gu976gg.mkv	109.73	121.03	Remember, it's going to add loft, it's going to subtract loft so the ball's going to go further than normal with whatever club you're using so take that into account and practice it and do the best you can.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	0.0	4.69	A great variation of the feeble to fakie, is the feeble 180 out.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	5.59	13.15	Basically you roll up to the transition, with your foot on the tail, front foot somewhere above the front two wheels, or front trucks.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	14.03	19.8	As soon as you get into the feeble position, you're going to want to shift your weight, and head back down.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	19.9	27.2	So you're going to want to get your two wheels off from the deck of the ramp, and back back onto the surface of the ramp and roll down forward.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	28.05	37.46	This is an especially fun trick, because it can lead you to grinding the feeble, and testing it out, and learning different variations of lip tricks.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	37.86	42.18	So, you head up the ramp, get locked in a feeble position.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	43.0	47.34	At this point, you're going to want to keep most of your weight on the inside of the ramp.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	47.83	64.08	Your front legs should be extended, to get the two front wheels on the front of your board, on the deck of the ramp, and then you're going to pivot your back truck and then point the board back into the quarter pipe or mini-ramp, and then roll back in.
euIZSPLCFRw.mp4	64.8	67.51	And that is how you do a feeble stall.
euQukoHpsms.mp4	89.49	90.61	I can feel it's dry.
euQukoHpsms.mp4	90.7	92.82	The moss inside looks really dry.
euQukoHpsms.mp4	92.82	93.88	It's not really pushing.
euQukoHpsms.mp4	93.88	94.69	It's kind of crunchy.
euQukoHpsms.mp4	95.23	96.86	So I want it to be soft.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	0.14	3.79	Here we're going to be talking about how to clean up your two in one hand pattern.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	3.99	6.12	So that you can later extrapolate that into four clubs.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	35.22	35.81	So watch again.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	35.81	37.99	Something like that.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	38.55	46.19	So you see, each club travels from my middle to the outside, angled a little bit out, and the spins are pretty close.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	47.97	49.37	You have to be able to do this with both hands.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	49.37	51.74	So not just your right hand, not strong your hand.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	51.77	54.44	Pick it up with your left hand too and do this same thing.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	54.49	56.16	There we go.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	56.16	61.48	And practice this for a really long time.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	61.64	64.15	Like, a very long time.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	64.5	66.0	A mind numbingly long time.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	6.39	10.11	Because basically you just have to do two in one hand with both hands at the same time.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	66.26	67.27	Until it's perfect.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	67.7	68.88	Or pretty close to perfect anyway.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	69.42	71.47	And then we can move on and add the fourth club.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	10.38	13.42	So each hand has to be very clean and independent of the other.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	13.48	14.8	When you actually pull in the fourth club.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	15.45	18.29	So what we're going to work on right now is you just take two clubs.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	18.77	22.95	And you sit there and you try and get this as clean as possible.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	23.51	26.11	You want, you don't want to do that.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	26.14	29.24	You want your double spins to be almost perfect.
euiCxEaTC_Q.mkv	29.36	34.84	You want your hands to be angled lightly outwards so that the clubs don't intersect and crash together.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	0.44	2.23	Hey, come on in.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	2.52	5.72	Today we're talking about how to treat dry hair.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	43.97	52.05	You want a product that has a PH of seven or below and these things are not going to over strip the hair of the natural oils.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	52.65	57.6	So also make sure that maybe once a month you give yourself a hot oil treatment.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	58.24	61.06	You can use avocado oil, peanut oil.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	61.31	66.56	You can use mineral oil and you can also use olive oil.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	66.56	70.74	Everyone has a little bit of olive oil and those things are good to help moisturize the hair.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	71.16	73.98	When you do this wrap the hair in a hot towel.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	74.19	78.72	This will help to open up the cuticles so that the oils can penetrate the hair shaft.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	79.05	81.64	They'll also leave your hair unbelievably shiny.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	82.27	86.7	Remember to go back and shampoo all of those oils out of the hair.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	87.54	90.14	So analyze the hair.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	6.12	12.25	Now first things first you want to analyze the hair and find out where the dryness is coming from.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	90.59	94.05	Look at your kitchen sink if you've got hair everywhere.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	94.41	97.86	You may be dry and lets get to the root of the problem.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	98.19	110.23	Remember healthy hair needs healthy shampoos and conditioners. Moisturizing shampoos and conditioners. My name is Sylvia this is how we treat dry hair.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	110.5	111.08	Thank you.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	13.12	17.89	So once we pick up the hair if it feels dry and brittle.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	18.18	21.2	If you got hair all over your bathroom counter.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	21.51	22.69	Your hair is dry.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	23.2	28.31	You might be over shampooing and using products that are high in alkalinity.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	28.68	29.95	Now what is alkalinity?
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	30.33	38.85	It's a professional term for us professionals but make sure if your shampoo is sudsing so, so much.
eunSKhLCwnA.mkv	39.83	43.31	That might mean that your products are high in alkalinity.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	43.12	43.33	Alright.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	43.33	47.58	So, after we do the three sixty flip, we are going to flip the board.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	47.66	48.94	We got the whole thing coming down.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	49.03	50.48	It is going to flip.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	50.48	55.97	And, probably around right here, you are going to start this black grip tape and you are going to want to start catching it with your front foot and back foot.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	56.55	57.6	You can do it all at the same time.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	57.6	59.04	Some people catch it with the front only.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	59.5	60.97	Some people catch it with their back foot only.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	61.37	62.79	Some people do a combination of both.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	63.46	68.29	But, when it starts coming around, you are going to want both of your feet and then you land on it like that.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	34.26	36.79	We got my left foot here.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	36.96	37.97	My front foot right here.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	38.76	41.26	And then, we kind of, like, scoop it up and flick at the same time.
eurMqgtnV5g.mp4	41.26	42.48	So, it is a scoop and a flick.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	0.76	3.23	This is how to read a simulcast screen.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	3.98	9.96	These right here, the one, the two, the three, the four, the five, the six and the seven.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	61.6	65.75	That depends on the track, the state, all those other things.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	66.04	71.86	If you?re not sure, go ahead and go ask one of the tellers of where you're at, they can answer those questions.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	74.63	79.21	This portion is always constantly changing as money gets added to the pool.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	79.84	85.87	These are going to be constantly scrolling, going through the numbers that are currently in that race.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	86.63	88.52	These numbers also change.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	89.11	91.46	If you remember, four was at a different odd.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	92.12	93.48	Now we're at a seven dash two.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	94.62	96.04	Seven was at a different odd.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	97.05	98.38	Seven was at fourteen.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	99.07	110.23	Some of these may be of different odds but as long as there are minutes to race, these odds will constantly be in jeopardy of changing.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	10.42	16.92	These are the numbers of the specific horse that someone may want to bet on.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	110.61	112.64	Which can be a very good thing.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	113.2	117.29	If I were to bet this race, I'd be putting most of my money on the four.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	18.31	22.95	To the right of those, are always the odds of that particular number.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	23.68	27.25	Number one horse is at four dash five or four fifths.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	28.35	35.23	The number two is at nine to one, meaning it should be paying approximately nine dollars for every one dollar bet.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	35.74	37.06	As long as the odds stay that way.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	39.28	50.27	Number three's at seven to one, number four's at three to one, number five's at seventeen to one, number six is at ten to one and number seven's at seventeen to one.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	50.34	57.59	Some of these tracks do things a little funky as actually this being eleven to two.
ev20hYBWaE4.mp4	58.49	60.76	For every two dollars bet, you win eleven.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	0.11	2.82	LES MCGEHEE: Alright, now we're going to close this segment with another game.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	2.82	6.13	This is a game that's from a category of games called Freeze game.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	49.98	50.29	PRODUCER: Okay.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	51.61	56.05	JOE PARSONS: Hey, has anybody seen my ant farm?
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	56.05	56.89	LES MCGEHEE: Hey.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	56.89	61.99	So the audience would be telling us whether or not they like that one.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	62.21	63.68	JOE PARSONS: Yeah.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	64.72	66.62	LES MCGEHEE: Oh.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	67.08	70.19	Hey uncle Yogi--sorry.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	70.19	72.87	JOE PARSONS: Well I'm glad you invited the bull.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	74.21	77.62	Let's just spread this tablecloth out.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	77.77	78.68	LES MCGEHEE: Alright.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	6.13	19.91	And actually we do perform this one like we perform the gibberish skill on stage, but we perform this game to close shows and we do it until one's funny and when one's funny--extra funny we say "thank you, goodnight" and it makes it look like we really knew what we were doing.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	78.68	85.14	What's a place where it's important to be quiet but it's not the library?
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	85.14	91.22	It's a tough question with just a couple of producers in the room.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	91.56	92.45	PRODUCER: Movies.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	92.45	94.64	LES MCGEHEE: At the movie theaters.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	94.64	97.78	World's Worst thing you might see or hear at the movie theater.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	97.78	98.94	Good luck with that Joe.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	98.94	104.97	JOE PARSONS: Thank you.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	104.97	105.59	Thank you.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	105.59	108.1	Ahahaha...she's dead.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	109.8	115.05	LES MCGEHEE: I've been waiting years for the new Britney Spears movie.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	19.91	26.74	This one is called World's Worst from one of our producers over here, what's a happy family gathering?
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	116.64	119.76	JOE PARSONS: What's that?
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	119.76	124.15	No, I can talk go ahead.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	124.15	124.3	Yeah, hahaha.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	124.3	127.29	Oh man no kidding, it's great.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	127.29	128.73	LES MCGEHEE: Hey and that's how that goes.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	128.73	130.3	So there's the game of World's Worst.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	130.3	132.73	It's about 20 good freeze games and that's one of them.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	136.83	139.27	I'll wait here with Joe while you go to the restroom.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	26.74	27.21	PRODUCER: A picnic.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	27.21	28.26	LES MCGEHEE: A picnic.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	28.26	35.03	So what we gotta try and do is we gotta try and offer you some of the world's worst things you might see or hear at a family picnic.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	35.03	37.16	Some of them will be good; some of them won't be good.
ev6p1HUAzOk.mp4	46.34	49.98	So we have here picnic--World's Worst picnic, Joseph.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	0.49	6.51	Now the "mic preamps" on the Control 24 are basically what allows you to record things.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	6.72	11.35	The mic preamps are the power to the mics and they control the input gain on the mics.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	68.95	77.27	You want to make sure that even though this is in the first track you make sure your interface says "mic 13" or "mic 2" or whatever it is that you're recording into.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	11.79	13.29	They're each of these on top of here.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	14.15	19.86	They actually go off to the back and that's where the XLR input is where you can plug up the microphone to.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	20.52	33.1	Now the first thing you could look at is the peak and the high pass filter as well as the source selection to add a mic line at -10 and you could look at the input gain and the record on.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	33.38	38.83	Now when looking at the back, the mic preamps all have phantom power switches that you have to hit on.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	39.03	45.2	You hit the phantom power switch on it supplies 40 volts to that mic so that you can record through the mic preamps.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	45.2	54.85	Now each of these mic preamps go to an existing track so you depending on what you are doing each one of these is going to go along to whatever input you have put in.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	54.85	61.37	So if you have number 13 right here and you turn on this mic preamp you got to make sure you assign 13 as the input to any of these tracks.
evCUsyLuif8.mp4	61.59	68.95	When you go into your session, you could see that depending if you have this track and you turn on mic 13.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	0.1	1.64	My name is Dr. Randall Hyde.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	38.99	40.24	Why did you choose to do this?
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	41.08	42.42	And just be curious.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	43.59	49.14	Explain to them to practice being the kind of person they want to be right now.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	49.94	52.72	You as a parent be dedicated to the higher role.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	53.13	53.99	What's right?
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	54.47	55.31	What's true?
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	55.39	56.1	What's noble?
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	56.1	56.94	What's good?
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	57.79	61.76	Create your future through imagination, planning, and goal setting.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	7.88	9.97	Choice is power.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	10.52	13.68	A good parent will focus on choices.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	13.93	15.76	They'll follow the choices in their children.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	16.64	19.13	We are responsible for our choices.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	20.06	29.4	Sometimes kids don't want to be responsible for their choices so they lie, they deny, they minimize, they blame, but the truth is they are always responsible.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	29.4	33.55	It is your job to hold them accountable and sometimes it's your consequence.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	34.29	37.07	Focus on choice with your children.
evHUckAEjGc.mp4	37.29	38.73	Why did you choose to do that?
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	0.7	8.8	Ok, the next thing that you have to do is find a balance in checking the email.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	8.8	13.67	There are sometimes extremes on letting email run your life.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	14.16	28.76	Even if you know you're going to receive hundreds of emails every day, don't be so obsessed with it, don't get so caught up in it that all of a sudden email, checking email, responding to email becomes your life.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	28.79	38.93	Yes it's much much easier than telephone conversations, it's so much easier than so many things but don't become obsessed with it, don't let it run your life.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	39.4	48.67	In the same respect, don't ignore it, you never check your email and people can't get you on the phone so they've been sending an email and you don't check that.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	49.25	56.48	Find a balance and that balance includes not checking your email when you go on vacation.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	57.51	62.34	Everybody is entitled to a break every now and then, let it go, take a vacation.
evJLWmXoRH0.mkv	62.69	69.73	What you have to get good at is figuring out what takes priority and we're going to talk about that next.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	0.68	7.51	Hi, this is John Stewart and this is how to make a spear stick to where you can use it for fishing, cooking, and other things.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	7.99	8.34	OK.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	8.67	10.55	Spear sticks are very easy to make.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	10.76	18.76	Just find a longer stick, you you're going to have to have knife or a rock with a sharp edge to where you can take and whittle it down to a point.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	18.86	29.78	OK. You want to get it a real sharp point so that it can stick through it, stuff. Fish, if you're trying to fish with it, OK. Like I said, it's got many uses, most common is fishing.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	29.78	40.11	If you can find a slow moving stream that you see fish in, care you up a spear stick, walk out there, wade in the water, and then just wait for a fish to come by.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	40.26	42.62	You have to be real, real still and real patient.
evXzC8F2TfI.mkv	43.06	49.24	Wait for a fish to get close and jab at the fish, and hopefully you can spear to fish to where you can have some food.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	60.11	68.72	Now to get out of triple singles, hopefully you don't drop, hopefully what happens is you can just go straight back into a 4-pattern, which would be your normal fountain.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	68.85	71.22	So let's see if we can show you what that looks like.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	71.37	81.24	So you're in a 4-pattern, switch to 5-3 and back to 4.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	81.45	85.43	Now it's also pretty common to just do one beat of triple singles.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	85.7	90.99	That is, you'll be juggling for throw a single triple, a single single and then go back into 4-4.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	91.75	99.46	You should probably practice this with both hands, work on out of your right and then your left and you can start working on some more advanced 4 club side swaps.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	42.42	47.82	That will be just your normal shower, or fountain I should say, your normal fountain straight into triple singles.
evZ7uarpvO4.mkv	48.26	59.03	So it looks something like this and I'll throw a five, and I'm right into triple singles.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	0.15	5.3	Now we're going to prep the lips with a lip moisturizer, or chap stick.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	5.33	8.24	Something that has a lot of moisture in it.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	71.4	71.57	Good.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	9.61	30.75	If the lips are nice and moist it's going to allow the lipstick to apply more evenly, and if they're actually chapped, you can mix some sugar with the chap stick, rub it onto the lips and then buff it off with either a sponge or a washcloth, and that'll exfoliate the top layer.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	33.91	34.6	Go ahead and blot.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	36.1	36.65	How's that feel?
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	37.13	38.05	Nice and moist?
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	39.2	44.11	So I'm going to let that set in for about thirty seconds and then we'll apply the lip liner.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	46.9	54.8	And notice how I used a tool to pull out the chap stick, that way you're keeping everything sanitary.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	55.71	61.77	So after using the tool you want to spray it off with an anti bacterial soap or spray.
evc9Fsd6gcM.mp4	65.98	67.93	That way we won't be spreading any germs.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	68.98	69.32	Thank you.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	69.32	70.28	This has been Liz Muller.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	36.08	44.32	Color treated hair, you might use a little less activator, and for hair that's, you know, just completely version, you might make it a little stronger.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	44.52	50.78	So it gives you options here with Affirm of how to mix your relaxer and what you would want for that client.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	51.13	53.71	There's also relaxer that just doesn't get mixed.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	53.71	55.53	It comes completely like this here.
evcypJTh9Go.mp4	56.03	68.59	As you'll see in this tub of Mizani, it's white, it's creamy, a little more coarser for Mizani than it is for Affirm, but there's different types and it's used on hair that needs to be straightened out when it's coarse and has curl.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	0.53	1.87	I'm Ivan Madar.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	7.78	18.24	Now, let's assume you are not probably athletic coordinated, you've not done anything athletic for a long time and suddenly you want to ski.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	18.7	25.86	The way we start you with the skis, we start showing you all the skills you need to learn first without skis on.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	26.33	29.78	We put the skis aside and we try it in your boots.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	29.78	34.86	We try it first to do the same elements we would do with skis on, without skis.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	35.24	46.93	And elements, I mean, sometimes walking up the hill, walking downhill without skis.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	47.93	63.63	We are going to teach you how to turn your feet rather than your whole body, how to put your feet in the proper position for a wedge position because that is the way we are going to initiate a turn later on.
evnAog27EEM.mkv	64.17	67.82	So, you learn how to put your feet in the proper position.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	0.5	3.86	I'm Jay French from Jay French from Jay French Studios dot com.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	74.75	78.57	I'm getting the edge of the ear in here.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	78.57	83.81	Again, here's where we can tell it's an African elephant, because they have much larger spread out ears.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	86.95	88.25	We're only going to see the edge of this one.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	90.08	94.28	And one of the main things about the face of an elephant is that it's shape is something of an hour glass.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	3.86	5.7	And I'm going to teach you how to draw an elephant.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	94.28	97.0	You have a bulb of a forehead.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	97.87	102.79	It indents, comes back out, where the eyes are.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	103.19	105.91	So from the, on this side we'll just have a shadow.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	106.83	111.13	On the outer edge we'll actually see that shape.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	114.17	116.04	Eyes are very small and proportionate.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	117.31	126.0	Of course one of the most prominent features of an elephant, and this is where you start to see it, is the wrinkles.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	126.8	127.59	The looseness of the skin.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	127.59	130.71	And you'll see it right around the eyes very prominently.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	132.11	135.58	From this angle we can't see the other eye.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	6.3	13.97	Of course you could do a cartoony elephant is going to be much simpler.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	153.04	153.92	It's very difficult to see.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	153.92	158.08	You basically they have to have their trunks raised in order to see an elephant's mouth.
evrAzgpD45c.mp4	14.12	17.06	But we're going to show you the basics of drawing a realistic elephant.
